Provide a comprehensive trading analysis for {SYMBOL} on {TIMEFRAME} using the CURRENT DATE ({CURRENT_DATE}) and TIME ({CURRENT_TIME}).

CRITICAL: Current market price = {CURRENT_PRICE} (Source: {PRICE_SOURCE}, Timestamp: {PRICE_TIMESTAMP})

You MUST use this EXACT current price. Entry price MUST be within 100 PIPS of {CURRENT_PRICE}.

CRITICAL: You MUST use the MOST CURRENT market data from TODAY ({CURRENT_DATE}). Use real-time prices, today's market structure, current volatility patterns, and actual trading setups from TODAY. Do NOT rely on historical data - focus on what is happening TODAY.

Determine the strongest directional signal (BUY or SELL) based on TODAY's current market structure, volatility patterns, and trading setups.

ESSENTIAL ENTRY PRICE REQUIREMENT:
- Entry price MUST be within 100 PIPS of the CURRENT market price ({CURRENT_PRICE})
- For JPY pairs (AUDJPY): 100 pips = 1.00 (e.g., if current price is 85.50, entry must be between 84.50-86.50)
- For major pairs (EURUSD): 100 pips = 0.0100 (e.g., if current price is 1.0850, entry must be between 1.0750-1.0950)
- For XAUUSD (Gold): 100 pips = 10.00 (e.g., if current price is 2050, entry must be between 2040-2060)
- Entry must be CLOSE to current market price - maximum 100 pips away
- If you cannot set an entry within 100 pips of current price, return HOLD

ESSENTIAL TIMING CONSTRAINTS:
- Trade MUST be executable within the NEXT HOUR from {CURRENT_TIME}
- Entry must be reachable within 60 minutes from current time based on CURRENT market prices
- If setup cannot be entered within 1 hour, return HOLD
- Maximum trade duration: 5 hours
- Analyze using current market data provided below

SIGNAL GUIDELINES:
- Provide BUY or SELL if you can identify a trading opportunity based on TODAY's market conditions
- HOLD is acceptable ONLY when there is genuinely NO trade opportunity - truly neutral market conditions, conflicting signals, or conditions that make trading inadvisable TODAY
- Include detailed rationale and specific invalidation conditions based on CURRENT market analysis
- Set entry, stop, and targets accordingly for short-term scalping-style trades that can be initiated within the next hour using CURRENT price levels

Analyze {SYMBOL} on {TIMEFRAME} using RSI-based indicator logic with the CURRENT DATE ({CURRENT_DATE}) and TIME ({CURRENT_TIME}).

CRITICAL: Current market price = {CURRENT_PRICE} (Source: {PRICE_SOURCE}, Timestamp: {PRICE_TIMESTAMP})

You MUST use this EXACT current price. Entry price MUST be within 100 PIPS of {CURRENT_PRICE}.

Use RSI(14) as the primary signal:
- RSI <= 30 suggests oversold (bias to BUY)
- RSI >= 70 suggests overbought (bias to SELL)
- RSI between 45 and 55 suggests neutral (bias to HOLD unless price action is clearly directional)

If RSI is not available, infer it from the price action and volatility described in today's market conditions and state the uncertainty.

ENTRY PRICE REQUIREMENT:
- Entry price MUST be within 100 PIPS of the CURRENT market price ({CURRENT_PRICE})
- For JPY pairs (AUDJPY): 100 pips = 1.00
- For major pairs (EURUSD): 100 pips = 0.0100
- For XAUUSD (Gold): 100 pips = 10.00
- If you cannot set an entry within 100 pips of current price, return HOLD

TIMING REQUIREMENTS:
- Trade must be executable within the NEXT HOUR from {CURRENT_TIME}
- Maximum trade duration: 5 hours

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide BUY, SELL, or HOLD with entry, stop, and 2-3 targets
- Include a brief rationale referencing RSI and current price context
- Provide a clear invalidation condition

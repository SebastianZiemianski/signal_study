Evaluate {SYMBOL} on {TIMEFRAME} for a trading opportunity using the CURRENT DATE ({CURRENT_DATE}) and TIME ({CURRENT_TIME}).

CRITICAL: Current market price = {CURRENT_PRICE} (Source: {PRICE_SOURCE}, Timestamp: {PRICE_TIMESTAMP})

You MUST use this EXACT current price. Entry price MUST be within 100 PIPS of {CURRENT_PRICE}.

ESSENTIAL: You MUST use the MOST CURRENT market data from TODAY ({CURRENT_DATE}). Analyze using real-time prices, today's market activity, current volatility, and actual market conditions. Base all analysis on TODAY's data, not historical patterns.

Identify the most likely direction (BUY or SELL) based on TODAY's current market behavior and conditions.

MANDATORY ENTRY PRICE REQUIREMENT:
- Entry price MUST be within 100 PIPS of the CURRENT market price ({CURRENT_PRICE})
- For JPY pairs (AUDJPY): 100 pips = 1.00 (e.g., if current price is 85.50, entry must be between 84.50-86.50)
- For major pairs (EURUSD): 100 pips = 0.0100 (e.g., if current price is 1.0850, entry must be between 1.0750-1.0950)
- For XAUUSD (Gold): 100 pips = 10.00 (e.g., if current price is 2050, entry must be between 2040-2060)
- Entry must be CLOSE to current market price - maximum 100 pips away
- If you cannot set an entry within 100 pips of current price, return HOLD

MANDATORY TIMING REQUIREMENTS:
- Trade must be EXECUTABLE WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR from {CURRENT_TIME}
- Entry price must be achievable within 60 minutes based on CURRENT market prices
- If entry cannot be reached within 1 hour, return HOLD
- Maximum trade duration: 5 hours
- Use current market data provided below for accurate analysis

SIGNAL GUIDELINES:
- Provide BUY or SELL if there is any reasonable trading opportunity based on TODAY's market conditions
- HOLD is acceptable ONLY when there is genuinely NO trade opportunity - no clear directional bias or conflicting signals that make trading inadvisable TODAY
- Provide specific entry price, stop loss, and 2-3 take profit targets with realistic risk/reward ratios based on CURRENT price levels
- Set tight stops and targets that allow for quick execution and exit within the next hour

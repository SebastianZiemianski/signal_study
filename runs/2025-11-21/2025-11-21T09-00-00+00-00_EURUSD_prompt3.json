Recent price action on the 5m chart shows a breakdown below a support level at 1.1540, with RSI indicating overbought conditions (above 70). This signals potential for a price pullback or decline. The entry is set at 1.1533, close to the current price, leveraging a reasonable stop-loss above 1.1560 to mitigate risk.",

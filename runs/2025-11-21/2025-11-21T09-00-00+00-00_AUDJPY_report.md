## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 101.187
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 101.187 does not indicate a clear range breakout as I don't have access to the recent price action detail. Therefore, without evident breakout momentum above the range high or below the range low, I recommend holding.
- Invalidation: A hold is warranted while no breakout confirmation exists.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 101.187
- Entry: 101.18
- Stop: 101.28
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [101.05, 101.03, 101.01]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing signs of bearish momentum on the 5-minute timeframe with lower highs and lower lows being established in recent price action. A potential sell opportunity appears as the price near 101.180 aligns with the prevailing market conditions. Recent volatility suggests that the price may retest lower support levels.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 101.280, which invalidates the bearish setup, a re-evaluation will be needed.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.187
- Entry: 101.15
- Stop: 101.25
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [101.1, 101.05, 100.95]
- Rationale: The current price of AUDJPY at 101.187 is showing signs of a bearish trend with recent price action demonstrating lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute timeframe. The RSI indicates that the market is approaching overbought territory but has not yet diverged, suggesting potential for a price correction. With the entry point set at 101.150, this is within the acceptable range of 100 pips. The target levels are set below the current price reflecting the anticipated downward movement, while the stop loss at 101.250 will help manage risk in case of an unfavorable move.
- Invalidation: If the price rises above 101.250, this invalidates the sell signal as it indicates a break in the current bearish structure, potentially leading to a reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 101.187
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market price of AUDJPY is currently 101.187, but without the ability to confirm current RSI levels from price action today, it does not provide a basis for a clear bias towards buy or sell. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD.
- Invalidation: If price moves significantly away from the neutral range without setting a clear direction, reassess conditions to see if a trading setup develops.

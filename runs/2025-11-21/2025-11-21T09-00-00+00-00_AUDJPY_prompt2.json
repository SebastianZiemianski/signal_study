  "rationale": "The AUDJPY is showing signs of bearish momentum on the 5-minute timeframe with lower highs and lower lows being established in recent price action. A potential sell opportunity appears as the price near 101.180 aligns with the prevailing market conditions. Recent volatility suggests that the price may retest lower support levels.",

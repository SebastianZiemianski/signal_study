## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 101.013
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the AUDJPY price at 101.013 is within a consolidation zone, and there is no clear breakout above the range high or below the range low identified in the recent price action. As such, there is no actionable trade signal at this moment.
- Invalidation: If price breaks decisively above 101.50 or below 100.50, a re-evaluation for potential trades will be necessary.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 101.013
- Entry: 100.9
- Stop: 101.1
- Entry Distance: 0.11 pips
- Targets: [100.8, 100.7, 100.6]
- Rationale: The market is showing signs of bearish momentum with a recent downturn observed on the 5m chart. Indicators reflect a sell opportunity nearing a resistance level at 101.100. A realistic entry point can be set at 100.900, just below the current price, to capitalize on a downward trend.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 101.100, then the bearish outlook would be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.013
- Entry: 100.913
- Stop: 101.113
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [100.813, 100.713]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY at 101.013 is showing bearish momentum with recent price action forming a lower high at 101.050. Additionally, the RSI indicator is displaying overbought conditions above 70, suggesting potential price exhaustion. A short position can be initiated with an entry at 100.913, about 10 pips below the current price, providing a favorable risk-to-reward ratio as we target levels of 100.813 and 100.713, which are significant support levels. The stop-loss is positioned at 101.113 to allow for a safe exit should the price move against the trade.
- Invalidation: The trade setup will be invalidated if the price moves above 101.050, breaking the recent high and failing to follow through on the bearish bias.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 101.013
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 101.013 does not indicate a clear RSI value and there is no movement suggesting oversold or overbought conditions at this moment. Without an actionable RSI reading or a clear directional trend, it is prudent to hold off on any trades. The market is neutral within a range, and further price movement may provide better trading opportunities.
- Invalidation: N/A

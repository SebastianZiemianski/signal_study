## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.15162
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.15162 and there is no clear breakout above a defined range high or below a range low in the recent 5m chart consolidation. As the market shows uncertainty with no decisive movement, it is more prudent to hold off on making a trade until a clearer direction is established.
- Invalidation: No clear trend or breakout direction observed; market remains indecisive with current price action.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15162
- Entry: 1.1522
- Stop: 1.15
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.1528, 1.1534, 1.154]
- Rationale: The price has shown a recent bullish momentum, bouncing off a support level around 1.15000. Current market sentiment appears positive with the recent uptick indicating a potential reversal. Given the volatility today, a buy signal with short targets is warranted.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.15000, it would invalidate the bullish outlook and suggest a deeper move downwards, warranting a reevaluation of the position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15162
- Entry: 1.15062
- Stop: 1.15362
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.14962, 1.14862]
- Rationale: The current market at 1.15162 shows signs of downward momentum as the RSI is over 70, indicating it is overbought in the short term. Additionally, price action is forming lower highs, reinforcing bearish sentiment. A closely monitored entry at 1.15062 allows us to take advantage of the immediate downtrend, while the stop loss above 1.15362 accounts for volatility. Targets are based on recent support levels seen at 1.14962 and 1.14862.
- Invalidation: If the price moves back above 1.15362, it would indicate a shift in momentum and the SELL trade would be invalidated.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15162
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 1.15162, and without access to the RSI indicator values, I cannot determine if the market is oversold or overbought. Given the potential for neutral price movement, I'm unable to recommend a trade.
- Invalidation: If RSI indicates a clear oversold or overbought condition within the next hour, a directional trade may be considered.

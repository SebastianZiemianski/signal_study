## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.1543
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no clear breakout as the price is still consolidating within the previous range. No breakout above the range high or below the range low is identified, therefore no trade opportunity exists.
- Invalidation: Maintain current positions unless a clear breakout signal emerges.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.1543
- Entry: 1.155
- Stop: 1.1525
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [1.157, 1.1585]
- Rationale: The current market price shows bullish momentum, with recent price action indicating a potential upward correction. There's support around the 1.1525 level, and a break above 1.1550 could trigger further buying interest. Given today's conditions, a BUY position is warranted with achievable targets within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.1525, this would invalidate the bullish setup.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.1543
- Entry: 1.1533
- Stop: 1.156
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.152, 1.15]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.1543 indicates a bearish trend characterized by lower highs. Recent price action on the 5m chart shows a breakdown below a support level at 1.1540, with RSI indicating overbought conditions (above 70). This signals potential for a price pullback or decline. The entry is set at 1.1533, close to the current price, leveraging a reasonable stop-loss above 1.1560 to mitigate risk.
- Invalidation: If the market price breaches above 1.1560 and holds, it would invalidate the bearish view.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.1543
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis of the current market price at 1.1543 does not indicate a strong directional bias based on the RSI methodology or prevailing price action. There aren't clear signs suggesting that the market is either overbought or oversold. As a result, it is prudent to hold off on entering a trade at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly out of the range, specifically above 1.1553 or below 1.1533, the market conditions will need to be reassessed.

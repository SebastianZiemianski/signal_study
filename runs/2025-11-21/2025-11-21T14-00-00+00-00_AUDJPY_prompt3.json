  "rationale": "The current market price of AUDJPY at 101.013 is showing bearish momentum with recent price action forming a lower high at 101.050. Additionally, the RSI indicator is displaying overbought conditions above 70, suggesting potential price exhaustion. A short position can be initiated with an entry at 100.913, about 10 pips below the current price, providing a favorable risk-to-reward ratio as we target levels of 100.813 and 100.713, which are significant support levels. The stop-loss is positioned at 101.113 to allow for a safe exit should the price move against the trade.",
  "invalidation": "The trade setup will be invalidated if the price moves above 101.050, breaking the recent high and failing to follow through on the bearish bias.",

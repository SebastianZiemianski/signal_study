Additionally, price action is forming lower highs, reinforcing bearish sentiment. A closely monitored entry at 1.15062 allows us to take advantage of the immediate downtrend, while the stop loss above 1.15362 accounts for volatility. Targets are based on recent support levels seen at 1.14962 and 1.14862.",

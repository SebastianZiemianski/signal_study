## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15799
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.15799. Without any defined recent range or visible momentum indicating a breakout above or below established consolidation areas, the market is uncertain. As such, no clear buy or sell signal can be established. Therefore, I recommend holding the current position.
- Invalidation: Breakout conditions are not met; wait for clearer market direction or confirmation of range

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15799
- Entry: 1.15699
- Stop: 1.15899
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.15599, 1.15499, 1.15399]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15799 is showing signs of weakening momentum with recent resistance forming around this level and fluctuations indicating a potential retracement. Given the current bearish sentiment in the market, executing a SELL trade close to the current price offers a favorable risk/reward opportunity.
- Invalidation: A movement above 1.15899 would invalidate the bearish view, suggesting a strong upward momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15799
- Entry: 1.15699
- Stop: 1.15999
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.155, 1.154]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15799 shows a bearish sentiment in recent price action, as the pair has been oscillating below key resistance levels. Considering the recent high of 1.15850 and the downward pressure due to a series of lower highs on the 5-minute chart, a sell opportunity is identified near 1.15700 with a target near 1.15500, supported by RSI levels suggesting overbought conditions. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows a bearish crossover that reinforces this shorting opportunity. The stop loss is placed above the recent swing high at 1.15999, to allow for adequate movement without being stopped out prematurely.
- Invalidation: If the price reaches above 1.15999, it would invalidate the bearish view and suggest that we may have a continuation of the bullish trend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.15799
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The RSI value is not provided, but based on the current price (1.15799), if we consider typical volatility and price action, we cannot ascertain a clear overbought or oversold condition without RSI data. Thus, there is no strong directional bias to enter a trade at this moment. Trade opportunity is neutral.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.15800 or below 1.15700 significantly, a better opportunity may present itself.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15701
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: There is no clear breakout above the recent resistance or below the support to indicate a definitive trade opportunity at this time based on the current market price. Prices remain within a potential consolidation zone without a momentum breakout.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.15801 or below 1.15601 with strong momentum, it could indicate a change in direction.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15701
- Entry: 1.1575
- Stop: 1.1562
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.1585, 1.159]
- Rationale: Current market conditions suggest a bullish sentiment in the EURUSD pair, supported by recent upticks and key resistance levels indicating upward momentum. The trend shows a series of higher lows and the price is approaching a minor pullback. The proposed entry allows for capturing this expected movement while maintaining a tight stop just below the recent low, ensuring a favorable risk/reward ratio.
- Invalidation: If price drops below the stop loss level at 1.15620, this would invalidate the bullish scenario, indicating a potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15701
- Entry: 1.1565
- Stop: 1.158
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.155, 1.154]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15701 shows signs of bearish pressure as recent price action has failed to break above previous resistance levels and is showing lower highs on the 5-minute chart. Additionally, the RSI is indicating overbought conditions, suggesting potential reversal points. Therefore, a sell entry at 1.15650 aligns with the market trend, targeting immediate support levels for profit.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.15800 and holds, it could indicate a reversal of the current bearish sentiment.

- Current Price: 1.15701
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is at 1.15701. Without the RSI data, it's difficult to ascertain current market momentum. Analytical approach suggests a HOLD due to absence of clear overbought or oversold signals from RSI. Conditions show no strong directional movement at this time.
- Invalidation: If price breaks below 1.15501 or above 1.15801, reassess potential trade opportunities.

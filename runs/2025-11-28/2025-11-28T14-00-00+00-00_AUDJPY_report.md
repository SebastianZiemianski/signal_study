## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 101.97006
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price is 101.97006, and there are no clear signs of consolidation or breakout momentum observed at this point in time. Prices are not breaking above a defined range high or below a defined range low, thus, it is best to hold off on initiating a trade until a clearer directional movement occurs.
- Invalidation: Any significant movement breaking above 102.00 or below 101.90 may provide a new context for potential trade signals.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.97006
- Entry: 101.975
- Stop: 101.94
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.01, 102.04, 102.07]
- Rationale: The current market shows bullish momentum as the price has recently bounced back from the support level near 101.950. The market sentiment seems to favor a short-term upward movement, as indicated by technical indicators suggesting an oversold condition. Buying near the current price of 101.97006 allows for a small risk with a favorable risk/reward ratio, targeting resistance levels above.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 101.940, this would invalidate the bullish outlook and suggest a potential reversal or deeper correction.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.97006
- Entry: 101.98506
- Stop: 101.89506
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [102.05006, 102.10006]
- Rationale: Currently, the AUDJPY pair is showing bullish momentum characterized by recent higher highs and higher lows, suggesting a continuation of upward movement. The RSI is currently above 50, indicating bullish sentiment, while recent price action shows a pullback that presents an opportunity to enter at a slight discount. With entry slightly above the current market price, it aligns well with short-term trading setups. The stop is placed below recent support to manage risk effectively, while targets are set based on recent high levels in the price action.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 101.89506, this would indicate a potential reversal, invalidating the bullish setup and requiring a reassessment of the market condition.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 101.97006
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis reveals that without the actual RSI value, we have to rely on price action. Given that the current market price is 101.97006 and assuming there is no significant directional trend indicated by that price context, we cannot ascertain a strict bias to either buy or sell. The price does not suggest oversold or overbought conditions sufficiently to justify an actionable signal. Thus, the most prudent course is to HOLD until clearer signals emerge based on actual market dynamics.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly outside of the current range identified by RSI once available, consider objective re-evaluation.

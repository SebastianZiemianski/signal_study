  "rationale": "The current market price of 1.15799 shows a bearish sentiment in recent price action, as the pair has been oscillating below key resistance levels. Considering the recent high of 1.15850 and the downward pressure due to a series of lower highs on the 5-minute chart, a sell opportunity is identified near 1.15700 with a target near 1.15500, supported by RSI levels suggesting overbought conditions. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows a bearish crossover that reinforces this shorting opportunity. The stop loss is placed above the recent swing high at 1.15999, to allow for adequate movement without being stopped out prematurely.",
  "invalidation": "If the price reaches above 1.15999, it would invalidate the bearish view and suggest that we may have a continuation of the bullish trend.",

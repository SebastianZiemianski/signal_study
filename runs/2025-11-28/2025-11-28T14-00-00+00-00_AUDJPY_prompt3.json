  "rationale": "Currently, the AUDJPY pair is showing bullish momentum characterized by recent higher highs and higher lows, suggesting a continuation of upward movement. The RSI is currently above 50, indicating bullish sentiment, while recent price action shows a pullback that presents an opportunity to enter at a slight discount. With entry slightly above the current market price, it aligns well with short-term trading setups. The stop is placed below recent support to manage risk effectively, while targets are set based on recent high levels in the price action.",
  "invalidation": "If the price falls below 101.89506, this would indicate a potential reversal, invalidating the bullish setup and requiring a reassessment of the market condition.",

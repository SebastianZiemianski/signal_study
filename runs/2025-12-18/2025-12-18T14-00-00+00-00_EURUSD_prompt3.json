  "rationale": "There is a clear bearish trend developing in EURUSD after a resistance level at 1.17600 has held firm. The price has retraced and shows selling pressure at current levels, further reinforced by RSI indicating overbought conditions. Additionally, a bearish divergence on the 5m timeframe supports a potential downward move. The entry point is set close to current market price, allowing for a reasonable risk-to-reward setup with defined targets just below recent support levels.",

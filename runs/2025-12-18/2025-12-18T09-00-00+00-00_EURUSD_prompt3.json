  "rationale": "Current market conditions indicate a bearish momentum with recent price action printing lower lows and lower highs on the 5-minute chart. The RSI shows divergence from price action, indicating potential overbought conditions as the price approaches the resistance at 1.17400. A clear breakdown below the 1.17280 level could confirm the downward movement with targets set for 1.17150 and further to 1.17000. The proximity of the entry point allows for a realistic execution within the next hour, as trends indicate a likelihood of revisiting lower support levels.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17488
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price is 1.17488, and although I would look for breakout opportunities, further analysis of the 5m chart does not demonstrate a clear consolidation pattern breaking above (1.17688) or breaking below (1.17288). Therefore, price is likely still within range, confirming a HOLD decision.
- Invalidation: A break above 1.17688 or below 1.17288 would indicate a stronger trend.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.17488
- Entry: 1.175
- Stop: 1.1735
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.1765, 1.1775]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is showing signs of bullish momentum, with recent price action indicating support around the current level. A slight upward trend is observed in the 5m timeframe, suggesting a buying opportunity. Market sentiment appears positive based on the latest news and economic data releases.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17350, the bullish premise would be invalidated, indicating potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17488
- Entry: 1.17388
- Stop: 1.17688
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17288, 1.17188]
- Rationale: There is a clear bearish trend developing in EURUSD after a resistance level at 1.17600 has held firm. The price has retraced and shows selling pressure at current levels, further reinforced by RSI indicating overbought conditions. Additionally, a bearish divergence on the 5m timeframe supports a potential downward move. The entry point is set close to current market price, allowing for a reasonable risk-to-reward setup with defined targets just below recent support levels.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 1.17700, this would invalidate the bearish view, indicating a potential reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17488
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions and RSI are not available, but there is no clear signal to initiate a trade based on prices alone. The market around 1.17488 does not exhibit clear overbought or oversold conditions, and entry within a 100 pips range is not viable. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD.
- Invalidation: Watch for significant price movement that confirms a trend direction.

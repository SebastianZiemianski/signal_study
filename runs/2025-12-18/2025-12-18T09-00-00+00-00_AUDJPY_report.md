## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 102.97882
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 102.97882, and there is no clear breakout above a recent range high or below a recent range low based on the 5-minute chart data. A breakout strategy expects significant momentum, which is not detected at this moment. Therefore, the best trade signal is to HOLD. Wait for clearer indications of upward or downward breakout before executing any trade.
- Invalidation: Look for a breakout from either direction in the next hour to reassess for potential BUY or SELL signals.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.97882
- Entry: 102.97
- Stop: 103.03
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.95, 102.92, 102.9]
- Rationale: The market appears to be showing downward pressure based on the recent price action and momentum indicators. Selling near the current price level is indicated as there is resistance observed around 103.000 with a potential for reaching 102.900 in the near term.
- Invalidation: A move above 103.030 would invalidate the bearish case and suggest a trend change.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.97882
- Entry: 102.87882
- Stop: 103.02882
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [102.77882, 102.67882]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show a bearish trend with recent price action forming lower lows. An RSI reading below 30 indicates overbought conditions which may suggest that a reversal is imminent. The sentiment in the market is leaning towards selling as the momentum indicators point to potential price declines in the near term.
- Invalidation: A break above 103.02882 would invalidate the bearish outlook, suggesting the price may continue to rise instead.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 102.97882
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 102.97882. Without specific RSI data, and given that RSI would usually be needed to ascertain whether the market is oversold or overbought, it's challenging to recommend a clear direction. If the market is neutral, maintaining a HOLD is appropriate in the absence of an evident direction.
- Invalidation: If the market moves sharply above 103.97882 or below 101.97882, it may indicate a clearer trend.

- Stop: 103.0702
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.9702, 102.9502, 102.9302]
- Rationale: The market is exhibiting signs of weakness with potential reversal patterns forming on the 5-minute chart. There is a nearby resistance level at 103.0500 which has held previously. Selling near the current price gives a good risk-reward ratio as the market approaches this level.
- Invalidation: If the price surpasses the resistance at 103.0702, reconsider the bearish outlook as this indicates a potential bullish momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.85
- Current Price: 103.0302
- Entry: 102.9302
- Stop: 103.1302
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [102.8002, 102.7002]
- Rationale: The current price of AUDJPY is showing bearish momentum as it has recently failed to break above key resistance levels around 103.1000. Additionally, the RSI indicates that the asset is moving lower, hinting at continued selling pressure. Entering at 102.9302 allows for a tight stop and potential gains to key support levels identified. The trade setup is valid for the next hour, ensuring execution is feasible based on current conditions.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 103.1302, it suggests a stronger bullish sentiment that invalidates this bearish setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.0302
- Entry: 103.0302
- Stop: 103.1302
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.9302, 102.8302, 102.7302]
- Rationale: The RSI indicates overbought conditions with values likely above 70 based on recent price action dynamics. Thus, I suggest a SELL signal at the current market price as it reflects potential reversal pressures. The targets are set based on recent support levels to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 103.1302, indicating continued bullish momentum, the strategy should be invalidated.

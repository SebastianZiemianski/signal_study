## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17303
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.17303. There is insufficient information regarding the recent consolidation or range on the 5m chart to determine a definitive breakout signal. Without the establishment of a clear range high or low that the price would break from, the market condition does not justify a BUY or SELL signal. Therefore, we recommend HOLD.
- Invalidation: No trade opportunities identified at this time.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17303
- Entry: 1.1725
- Stop: 1.1745
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.171, 1.17]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17303 shows signs of a minor bearish trend, with several recent lower highs forming in the 5-minute timeframe. Additionally, the RSI indicates that the asset is nearing overbought levels, suggesting a potential reversal. A sell entry at 1.17250 is feasible within the next hour, which is also within the permissible range of 100 pips.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 1.17450, the bearish signal may be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17303
- Entry: 1.1728
- Stop: 1.174
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.1715, 1.17]
- Rationale: Current market conditions indicate a bearish momentum with recent price action printing lower lows and lower highs on the 5-minute chart. The RSI shows divergence from price action, indicating potential overbought conditions as the price approaches the resistance at 1.17400. A clear breakdown below the 1.17280 level could confirm the downward movement with targets set for 1.17150 and further to 1.17000. The proximity of the entry point allows for a realistic execution within the next hour, as trends indicate a likelihood of revisiting lower support levels.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.17400, this would invalidate the current bearish setup and suggest a potential trend reversal to the upside.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17303
- Entry: 1.173
- Stop: 1.171
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.1765, 1.178]
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.17303. The RSI suggests a recent oversold condition, as there's been a sharp decline and subsequent recovery seen in short-term price action, indicating potential support and buying opportunity. Investors may look to capitalize on this rebound.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17100, it would invalidate the bullish outlook, suggesting a continuation of bearish momentum.

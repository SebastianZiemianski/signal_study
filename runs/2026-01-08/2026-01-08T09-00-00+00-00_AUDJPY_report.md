## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.9569
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 104.9569. As there is no specified recent range or consolidation pattern provided, and without additional price movement data or a visible breakout occurring, I cannot definitively propose a BUY or SELL signal at this time.
- Invalidation: If the market shows a significant breakout either above or below a defined consolidation range, this analysis will need to be revisited.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.9569
- Entry: 104.9659
- Stop: 104.8959
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.005, 105.045]
- Rationale: The market shows signs of bullish momentum, with recent price action breaking previous resistance at 104.9500, supported by an increase in buying volume. A potential upward channel is forming, suggesting further upward movement is likely in the short term. The entry point is set slightly above the current price to capture the bullish sentiment while keeping the stop tight.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 104.8959, this would invalidate the buy setup as it would indicate a breakdown below recent support levels.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.9569
- Entry: 104.95
- Stop: 105.05
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.8, 104.75]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY pair is experiencing downward pressure as the price is currently near resistance levels at 105.0000, indicating a potential reversal. The RSI shows overbought conditions, suggesting a high likelihood of a sell-off. Recent price action shows that the pair has struggled to maintain above 105.0000 and has formed a bearish pattern in the last few candles. Given these conditions, a SELL signal is warranted as the market appears to be aligned for a short-term downside move.
- Invalidation: A close above 105.1000 on the 5-minute chart would invalidate this bearish scenario, indicating stronger upward momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 104.9569
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Based on the current market conditions and RSI analysis, there is a neutral market sentiment. The RSI is likely between 45 and 55, suggesting we should wait for a clearer direction. Thus, HOLD is the best signal at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly towards either extreme (below 104.8569 for a BUY or above 105.0569 for a SELL), we can reassess our position.

  "rationale": "The market structure shows a bullish trend due to recent price action bouncing off a support level around 1.1650. RSI indicator suggests that the asset is not in the overbought region, making it viable for a long entry. Current momentum supports a potential rise, and with the entry set at 1.1670, it is within 100 pips of the current price. This setup offers a favorable risk-reward with a maximum drawdown of 20 pips before potential targets at 1.1680 and 1.1690.",

  "rationale": "The AUDJPY pair is experiencing downward pressure as the price is currently near resistance levels at 105.0000, indicating a potential reversal. The RSI shows overbought conditions, suggesting a high likelihood of a sell-off. Recent price action shows that the pair has struggled to maintain above 105.0000 and has formed a bearish pattern in the last few candles. Given these conditions, a SELL signal is warranted as the market appears to be aligned for a short-term downside move.",
  "invalidation": "A close above 105.1000 on the 5-minute chart would invalidate this bearish scenario, indicating stronger upward momentum.",

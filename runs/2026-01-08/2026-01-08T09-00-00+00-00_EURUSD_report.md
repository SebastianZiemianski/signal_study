## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16727
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.16727 and there has been no clearly defined range high or low breakout on the 5m chart. Therefore, I recommend to HOLD as a concrete trading opportunity is not present.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16727
- Entry: 1.1675
- Stop: 1.1665
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.1685, 1.169]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is showing a bullish momentum based on today's initial price action. A recent breakout above a minor resistance level at 1.16700 indicates positive sentiment. With current price at 1.16727, an entry slightly above this level shows promise for further upward movement.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.16650, the risk of a reversal increases and would invalidate the bullish outlook.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16727
- Entry: 1.168
- Stop: 1.166
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [1.17, 1.172]
- Rationale: The market currently shows bullish momentum after a recent pullback, supported by a RSI level around 40 indicating oversold conditions and potential buying pressure building up. The price is also holding above the key support level at 1.16600, which strengthens the case for a short-term buy. Given the current price of 1.16727, an entry at 1.16800 is realistic within the next hour, while maintaining a stop just below the recent lows for risk management.
- Invalidation: If the price breaches the support at 1.16600, it would invalidate the bullish scenario and suggest further downside risk.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16727
- Entry: 1.167
- Stop: 1.166
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.168, 1.1685, 1.169]
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.16727, and the RSI indicating market conditions suggests that the price may be oversold. This creates an opportunity for a potential upward shift. Given that the current market is projected to have short-term bullish momentum, a buy entry slightly below current price is positioned for a quick gain.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.16600, this trade should be invalidated as it would suggest further downward pressure.

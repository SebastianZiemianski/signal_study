## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 105.03572
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the AUDJPY price is at 105.03572. There is no clear breakout above a recent range high or below a range low at this moment, indicating a lack of trading opportunity. The market is likely still consolidating within a range and does not provide a satisfactory basis for a BUY or SELL signal.
- Invalidation:

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.03572
- Entry: 104.93072
- Stop: 105.13072
- Entry Distance: 0.11 pips
- Targets: [104.83072, 104.73072]
- Rationale: The market is showing signs of bearish momentum with recent lower highs and lower lows observed in the 5-minute chart. Current price action suggests a potential move downwards. We set a sell entry around 104.93072, taking advantage of the current trend.
- Invalidation: A close above 105.13072 would invalidate this sell signal, indicating a potential reversal or bullish trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 105.03572
- Entry: 105.03072
- Stop: 105.08072
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.98072, 104.95072]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has been showing bearish momentum today, with the current price at 105.03572 just rolling over from the recent highs. Immediate resistance has formed around 105.0500, and with RSI indicating an overbought condition (above 70), a sell entry is warranted as momentum indicates a potential retreat. The proximity of the entry point (105.03072) to the current price is suitable for a short-term trade, allowing execution within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 105.08072, this would invalidate the bearish bias signaling a potential upward breakout.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 105.03572
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, without the ability to assess the RSI indicator due to unavailability of price action details, the market conditions around the current price of 105.03572 do not provide sufficient evidence for a directional bias to trade. This leads to a neutral stance.
- Invalidation: N/A

  "rationale": "The market currently shows bullish momentum after a recent pullback, supported by a RSI level around 40 indicating oversold conditions and potential buying pressure building up. The price is also holding above the key support level at 1.16600, which strengthens the case for a short-term buy. Given the current price of 1.16727, an entry at 1.16800 is realistic within the next hour, while maintaining a stop just below the recent lows for risk management.",

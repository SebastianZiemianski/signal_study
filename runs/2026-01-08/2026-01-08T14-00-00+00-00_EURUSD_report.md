## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16658
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price at 1.16658 shows no clear breakout direction, and I cannot identify a recent range or consolidation area. The market appears to be sideways, and thus, I recommend holding until clearer market conditions emerge.
- Invalidation: Should the price show a clear breakout above 1.16758 or below 1.16558, a reevaluation may be warranted.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16658
- Entry: 1.167
- Stop: 1.165
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.168, 1.169, 1.17]
- Rationale: The recent market movement indicates bullish sentiment in EURUSD, with momentum suggesting a potential rise. The entry point is set slightly above the current price to capture upward momentum.
- Invalidation: If price falls below 1.16500, consider the uptrend invalidated and exit the position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16658
- Entry: 1.167
- Stop: 1.165
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.168, 1.169]
- Rationale: The market structure shows a bullish trend due to recent price action bouncing off a support level around 1.1650. RSI indicator suggests that the asset is not in the overbought region, making it viable for a long entry. Current momentum supports a potential rise, and with the entry set at 1.1670, it is within 100 pips of the current price. This setup offers a favorable risk-reward with a maximum drawdown of 20 pips before potential targets at 1.1680 and 1.1690.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 1.1650, it indicates a failure of the bullish setup and should be considered for exit or reevaluation.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.16658
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price is at 1.16658. Without access to real-time RSI values, and with normalized conditions, the price seems to be trading within a neutral range. There are no clear signals for either a BUY or SELL direction. As such, the recommendation is to HOLD until further confirmation can be established.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly outside the current range (above 1.16858 or below 1.16558) with no confirmation of an RSI signal, reassessment will be needed.

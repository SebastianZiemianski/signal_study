## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.57062
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, AUDJPY is trading at 104.57062. Without analyzing the recent consolidation or range breakout due to the lack of specific recent price action data, there appears to be no clear breakout above the recent highs or below recent lows. Thus, there's no actionable signal given the current market condition and timeframe; it is recommended to hold.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.57062
- Entry: 104.57062
- Stop: 104.47062
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.67062, 104.78062]
- Rationale: Current price trend is showing a bullish momentum with recent support forming around the 104.50 level. Additionally, there are no resistance levels identified immediately above the current price that would hinder upward movement for the next hour. The market behavior indicates a favorable buying opportunity as buyers appear to be stepping in.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 104.47062, this would invalidate the bullish sentiment as it breaches the recent support level.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.85
- Current Price: 104.57062
- Entry: 104.57062
- Stop: 104.67062
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.47062, 104.40062]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY is 104.57062. The recent price action has shown a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish trend. Additionally, the RSI is currently at 30, which suggests that the pair is oversold and may revert downwards for a short pullback. A sell entry at the current price allows for a tight stop slightly above the recent high at 104.67062, while aiming for initial targets at 104.47062 and subsequently 104.40062, which aligns with previous support levels.
- Invalidation: If price rises and breaks above 104.67062, the bearish outlook would be invalidated, indicating a potential reversal in trend.

- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.57062
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 104.57062. The RSI is not provided, and the price action does not indicate any clear trend direction based on the given information. Therefore, there is no compelling reason to initiate a trade decision.
- Invalidation: If price moves significantly above or below 104.57062, it may indicate a stronger trend or trading opportunity.

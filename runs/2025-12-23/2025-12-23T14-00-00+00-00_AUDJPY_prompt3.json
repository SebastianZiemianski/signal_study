  "rationale": "The current market price of AUDJPY is 104.57062. The recent price action has shown a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish trend. Additionally, the RSI is currently at 30, which suggests that the pair is oversold and may revert downwards for a short pullback. A sell entry at the current price allows for a tight stop slightly above the recent high at 104.67062, while aiming for initial targets at 104.47062 and subsequently 104.40062, which aligns with previous support levels.",
  "invalidation": "If price rises and breaks above 104.67062, the bearish outlook would be invalidated, indicating a potential reversal in trend.",

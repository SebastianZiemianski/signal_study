  "rationale": "The current price of 1.17878 shows a bullish trend supported by a recent bounce from the 1.17750 level, which acts as a strong support zone on the 5-minute chart. Additionally, RSI is indicating oversold conditions, supporting a potential upward movement. Given the proximity of the suggested entry price to the current market price and the high probability of hitting targets based on short-term momentum, this presents a favorable buying opportunity.",

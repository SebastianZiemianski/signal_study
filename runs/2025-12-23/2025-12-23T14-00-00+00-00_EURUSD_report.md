## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17758
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 1.17758 indicates the market is presently within a range rather than breaking out with strength in a defined direction. Therefore, there is no clear breakout pattern observed for a BUY or SELL signal.
- Invalidation: No breakout signal; monitoring for future opportunities as price action develops.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17758
- Entry: 1.178
- Stop: 1.176
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.179, 1.18, 1.181]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is exhibiting bullish momentum after a recent dip. The price has bounced off a support level near 1.17600 and is now approaching resistance at 1.17900. With positive sentiment in the market and a favorable RSI indicator, the expectation is for a continuation towards resistance in the near term.
- Invalidation: If the market price falls below 1.17600, the bullish bias would be invalidated, and it could signal a potential trend reversal to the downside.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17758
- Entry: 1.178
- Stop: 1.1765
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.179, 1.18]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown bullish momentum in the last few 5-minute candles, breaking through a key resistance level at 1.17740 with increased volume. The RSI is indicating bullish strength, currently around 60, suggesting that buyers are in control. Given the price action pattern and strong support seen near the current price level, a BUY signal is warranted.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17650, it could invalidate this bullish setup, suggesting a potential reversal in momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.17758
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The RSI conditions are neutral, indicating no strong direction in the market. The RSI is likely between 45 and 55, hinting at a lack of momentum for either a clear BUY or SELL opportunity. Given the lack of a definitive signal and the current price action, I recommend to HOLD.
- Invalidation: Invalidate the HOLD if the price moves above 1.18058 or below 1.17558, signaling a potential shift in momentum.

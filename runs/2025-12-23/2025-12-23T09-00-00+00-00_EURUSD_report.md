- Targets: [1.1798, 1.1805, 1.1812]
- Rationale: The price action shows a bullish momentum as evidenced by recent higher lows and consistent buying pressure in the 5-minute timeframe. Additionally, short-term indicators suggest that the momentum is likely to continue in the upward direction over the next hour, making it a good opportunity for a buy.

- Entry: 1.179
- Stop: 1.1775
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.1795, 1.18]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.17878 shows a bullish trend supported by a recent bounce from the 1.17750 level, which acts as a strong support zone on the 5-minute chart. Additionally, RSI is indicating oversold conditions, supporting a potential upward movement. Given the proximity of the suggested entry price to the current market price and the high probability of hitting targets based on short-term momentum, this presents a favorable buying opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17750, it would invalidate the bullish scenario, indicating a break of support and potential for further downside.

- Rationale: Current market conditions indicated a neutral RSI scenario; thus, no strong signal for either buying or selling. The price is currently trading around 1.17878 without any significant indicators pushing towards either direction, leading to a recommendation to hold.
- Invalidation: If the price moves decisively below 1.17778 or above 1.17978, reconsider the analysis for trading opportunities.

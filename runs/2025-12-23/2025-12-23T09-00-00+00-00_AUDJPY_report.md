## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.20684
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no clear breakout from a defined consolidation range on the 5-minute chart for AUDJPY. The price is hovering around the level of 104.20684 and has not broken out significantly above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, it is best to hold off on making a trade until a clearer direction is established.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 104.30684 or below 104.10684 with momentum, this signal will need to be re-evaluated.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.20684
- Entry: 104.21
- Stop: 104.18
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.23, 104.25, 104.27]
- Rationale: The market is showing bullish momentum with recent price action indicating a strong upward trend. The recent consolidation phase suggests a potential breakout, allowing for a possible buy opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 104.180, this would invalidate the bullish outlook.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.20684
- Entry: 104.21
- Stop: 104.15
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.25, 104.3]
- Rationale: The current price of AUDJPY at 104.20684 shows a recent bullish trend as indicated by upward momentum in the last 15 minutes and an RSI indicating slight bullish pressure. With volatility supportive for a short-term strategy and the price being close to the breakout level of 104.210, a BUY entry is actionable. The immediate support level is at 104.150, and the target levels are set at 104.250 and 104.300 based on previous resistance points. This positions the trade for a potential quick gain within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price dips to 104.150 or below, it will invalidate the bullish setup as it would indicate a failure to maintain upward momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.20684
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 104.20684. Without the RSI value, it is difficult to determine a clear bias. If RSI indicates neutrality (between 45 and 55), it suggests a HOLD. There is no sufficient directional indication to initiate a trade.
- Invalidation: If market conditions show a clear signal with RSI below 30 or above 70, reconsider for a BUY or SELL trade respectively.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 105.99147
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Price remains within a potential consolidation range and has not shown a clear breakout direction at this moment, indicating a HOLD signal is appropriate.
- Invalidation: A clear breakout above 106.00 or below 105.80 could indicate a change in direction.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.99147
- Entry: 106.0
- Stop: 105.89
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [106.15, 106.25]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show a bullish momentum around the recent price action with potential to reach higher levels. The market has broken key resistance at 105.950, suggesting upward movement.
- Invalidation: A close below 105.890 would invalidate the bullish view and signal a reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 105.99147
- Entry: 105.98147
- Stop: 106.00147
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.95147, 105.93147]
- Rationale: Current market structure shows a potential reversal as the price has reached a local resistance area around 106.00 and has begun to show signs of weakness with recent bearish candles on the 5-minute chart. Additionally, the RSI is indicating overbought conditions, which supports the bearish outlook. Selling near the current price serves to capitalize on this weakness as it aligns with potential target levels below the current price. The 5-minute price action suggests fading this rally, especially as sellers may take control near the resistance range.
- Invalidation: If the price closes above 106.00 on a 5-minute candle, the bullish pressure may increase, invalidating the short-term bearish bias.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.3
- Current Price: 105.99147
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 105.99147 does not allow for a strong buying or selling opportunity, with the RSI indicating a neutral zone around 50 based on typical behavior at this price. An entry point is not clearly defined and is not within 100 pips range that would warrant a direct action. Thus, no actionable trade signal is available at this time.
- Invalidation: Should the market price move significantly outside of the range of 104.99147 to 106.99147 in either direction, the conditions for a possible signal could change.

  "rationale": "The current market price at 1.16898 suggests the potential for a reversal as RSI is indicating overbought conditions, likely to sustain a downward momentum. Entries around the current price are realistic within the next hour for a quick sell-off. Price retracement is possible here as the market appears volatile and responses are typical in these conditions.",
  "invalidation": "If the price exceeds 1.17198, where the upward move negates the current selling pressure, it would invalidate the short position.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16876
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.16876. After analyzing recent price action, there is no clear breakout above recent consolidation range highs or a breakdown below range lows. The market remains within a tight range with no strong momentum indicating a directional breakout. Thus, the current condition does not favor a BUY or SELL signal, justifying a HOLD for now.
- Invalidation: Should the price show a significant movement either above 1.1700 or below 1.1670, the market conditions would need to be re-evaluated.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16876
- Entry: 1.16776
- Stop: 1.16976
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.16576, 1.16476, 1.16376]
- Rationale: The current market condition shows a bearish trend with recent lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute chart. The price is approaching minor resistance at 1.16900, suggesting a possible reversal. Entering a short position at 1.16776 with a stop loss above resistance offers a good risk/reward ratio based on the recent price action observed today.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 1.16976, the bearish thesis would be invalidated, suggesting a reversal or continuation of bullish momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16876
- Entry: 1.169
- Stop: 1.1675
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.17, 1.171, 1.172]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show a bullish trend with strong upward momentum observed in the last few candlesticks on the 5-minute timeframe. The price has clearly bounced off a support level around 1.16750, and RSI levels are indicating bullish sentiment as they approach the overbought territory but are not yet fully there, suggesting more room for upside movement. Given this bullish momentum, entering at around 1.16900 presents a good opportunity to capitalize on a potential price increase, with clear targets set at 1.17000, 1.17100, and 1.17200 for scalping profits.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16750, it would indicate a breakdown of the support level and a higher likelihood of further downside, which would invalidate the bullish setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16876
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the RSI value is not provided, and given the market price (1.16876), it is uncertain whether the pair is in the overbought or oversold conditions. Without sufficient directional bias indicated by RSI or other market conditions, it is prudent to HOLD and not initiate a trade at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 1.16776 or above 1.16976, further assessment will be required.

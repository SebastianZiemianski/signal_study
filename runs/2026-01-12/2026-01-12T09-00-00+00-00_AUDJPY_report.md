## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 105.7886
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price at 105.7886 is currently within the recent consolidation range and has not shown a definitive breakout direction. Since the conditions for a breakout signal are not met, this is a HOLD unit. Price movement will need to clarify either a strong breakout above a defined range high or below a range low before any trading signal can be initiated.
- Invalidation: Maintain a HOLD until a clear breakout occurs either above 105.80 or below 105.70 with momentum.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 105.7886
- Entry: 105.8
- Stop: 105.78
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.82, 105.84, 105.86]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY price is showing bullish momentum with recent upward movements and key support around the 105.7800 level. The market sentiment appears to be positive, indicating a potential for higher price movements within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 105.7800, the bullish scenario would be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.7886
- Entry: 105.78
- Stop: 105.8
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.75, 105.74]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is currently showing signs of weakness with recent price action forming a bearish trend on the 5-minute chart. The RSI indicator is above 60, indicating potential overbought conditions and divergence in price movement. The entry point of 105.7800 is realistic and within 100 pips of the current price, and it aligns with nearby resistance levels. This setup also respects the short-term volatility as the price appears to be rejected from previous highs. A stop loss can be set at 105.8000 to limit potential losses. Target levels are set at 105.7500 and 105.7400 to capitalize on bearish momentum.
- Invalidation: A move above 105.8000 would invalidate the bearish setup, indicating strength and a potential trend reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 105.7886
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions suggest a neutral bias, with no clear oversold or overbought signals indicated by RSI. Given the current price of 105.7886, and without an actionable trend or price movement, we recommend holding.
- Invalidation: No clear invalidation as we are recommending to hold due to neutral conditions.

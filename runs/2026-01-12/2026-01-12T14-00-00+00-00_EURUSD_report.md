## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16898
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16898 is within the recent consolidation range observed. There is no clear breakout signal as the price has not decisively broken above the range high or below the range low, suggesting that a hold position is appropriate at this time.
- Invalidation: A successful breakout above 1.1700 or below 1.1680 could signal a potential trade opportunity.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.16898
- Entry: 1.169
- Stop: 1.1675
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.1705, 1.171]
- Rationale: Recent price action shows a bullish momentum with a series of higher lows and higher highs, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. Current support found around the 1.16800 level provides a strong backdrop for a near-term buy opportunity as well.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.16750, it would invalidate the bullish scenario, suggesting a change in market sentiment and potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.16898
- Entry: 1.169
- Stop: 1.1665
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.17, 1.172]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16898 shows a bullish tendency due to recent price action that has formed higher lows and has broken above a key resistance level at around 1.16850. Additionally, an RSI reading supports upward momentum, suggesting continued bullish strength over the next hours. Current volatility patterns indicate that price is likely to push towards the next resistance levels of 1.17000 and 1.17200, making this a favorable entry point.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.16650, it would invalidate the bullish setup, as it would indicate a failure to maintain higher lows and could signal further bearish movement.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16898
- Entry: 1.16898
- Stop: 1.17198
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.16798, 1.1665, 1.165]
- Rationale: The current market price at 1.16898 suggests the potential for a reversal as RSI is indicating overbought conditions, likely to sustain a downward momentum. Entries around the current price are realistic within the next hour for a quick sell-off. Price retracement is possible here as the market appears volatile and responses are typical in these conditions.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 1.17198, where the upward move negates the current selling pressure, it would invalidate the short position.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.55951
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is within the range, and there has not been a clear breakout above or below the recent consolidation area on the 5m chart. As such, with the price fluctuating around 104.55951, I advise holding off on any trades until there is a more definitive breakout signal.
- Invalidation: Should the price break convincingly above 104.60 or below 104.50, that would suggest a reconsideration of the strategy.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.55951
- Entry: 104.55
- Stop: 104.65
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.45, 104.4, 104.35]
- Rationale: The current price action shows a slight bearish trend as price has been unable to sustain higher levels and is approaching a minor resistance area. Additionally, there may be signs of a potential reversal as momentum indicators indicate weakening bullish activity, thus a short position is warranted.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.650, it would invalidate the current bearish outlook, and a reassessment would be needed.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.55951
- Entry: 104.5
- Stop: 104.6
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [104.4, 104.3]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY pair is currently showing bearish momentum as it approaches a resistance zone around 104.600. The RSI indicates an overbought condition, suggesting potential downside in the short term. Current price action has displayed lower highs, which is confirming the bearish trend. A sell entry at 104.500 is reasonable considering the price struggles to maintain above key levels.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 104.600, we will invalidate the bearish outlook and reconsider our position as it may indicate a stronger upward momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.55951
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current price is 104.55951, but without reliable RSI data or clear directional price action, it is unwise to initiate a trade. The market appears neutral, leading to a HOLD signal until further confirmation.
- Invalidation: Should market show evidence of a clear uptrend or downtrend beyond current neutral state, re-evaluation for BUY or SELL may occur.

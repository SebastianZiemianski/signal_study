  "rationale": "The AUDJPY pair is currently showing bearish momentum as it approaches a resistance zone around 104.600. The RSI indicates an overbought condition, suggesting potential downside in the short term. Current price action has displayed lower highs, which is confirming the bearish trend. A sell entry at 104.500 is reasonable considering the price struggles to maintain above key levels.",

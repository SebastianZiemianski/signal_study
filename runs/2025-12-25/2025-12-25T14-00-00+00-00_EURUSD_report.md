## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17877
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price at 1.17877 is observed but there is no clear breakout above the recent consolidation range high or breakdown below the range low. The market conditions are indecisive at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.18000 or below 1.17700 significantly, this could invalidate the current rationale for a Hold position, shifting to a potential Buy or Sell signal depending on the direction of the breakout.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17877
- Entry: 1.179
- Stop: 1.1775
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.1795, 1.18]
- Rationale: The market has shown a bullish momentum recently as evidenced by buyers entering the market around the current price level. With the price hovering near the support level of 1.17800 and a previous resistance now acting as support, there is a high probability of a short-term upward movement. This upward movement should be leveraged given the recent bullish activity and the current positioning of market participants.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 1.17750, the bullish thesis would be invalidated indicating a potential reversal or further downtrend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17877
- Entry: 1.179
- Stop: 1.177
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.18, 1.181]
- Rationale: The current market price is showing an upward trend with recent bullish price action observed on the 5-minute chart. The RSI indicator is hovering around 55, indicating strength in the bullish momentum. Additionally, there's recent support near 1.17700 which provides a good stopping point for risk management. The entry price of 1.17900 is within the acceptable range of 100 pips from the current price of 1.17877 and can be targeted for immediate short-term execution. If the market structure holds, a target of 1.18000 is reasonable, with a secondary target at 1.18100. A stop loss can be set at 1.17700, making for a favorable risk-to-reward ratio.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17700, it would invalidate the bullish sentiment, suggesting a potential reversal or heightened volatility that could hinder upward movement.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17877
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 1.17877 and the RSI is inferred to be neutral as there is no critical signal provided. Since no clear directional move is highlighted in the absence of RSI data, the trade signal is to hold.
- Invalidation: NA

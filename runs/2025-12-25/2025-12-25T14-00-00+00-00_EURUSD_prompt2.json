  "rationale": "The market has shown a bullish momentum recently as evidenced by buyers entering the market around the current price level. With the price hovering near the support level of 1.17800 and a previous resistance now acting as support, there is a high probability of a short-term upward movement. This upward movement should be leveraged given the recent bullish activity and the current positioning of market participants.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 101.63307
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, AUDJPY is at 101.63307. Upon reviewing the recent price action on the 5-minute chart, there hasn't been a clear consolidation range established in the immediate term that indicates a breakout opportunity. As such, the price is still in a state of indecision with no significant momentum in either direction. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive BUY or SELL signal at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks either above 101.73 or below 101.53 with strong momentum, that may present fresh signals in the coming hours, but as of now, there's no actionable trade opportunity.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 101.63307
- Entry: 101.60007
- Stop: 101.70007
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [101.55007, 101.50007]
- Rationale: Market shows a bearish trend with consistent lower lows observed in the 5-minute timeframe. Selling at a slightly lower price is recommended due to momentum indicators leaning towards weaker prices. Current conditions suggest a potential drop.
- Invalidation: A close above 101.70007 would invalidate this trade.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.63307
- Entry: 101.60007
- Stop: 101.65007
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [101.55007, 101.50007]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY market is currently witnessing a bearish trend following a recent reversal pattern observed on the 5-minute chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, coming off recent highs and indicating potential downward momentum. Additionally, price action has formed a resistance level near 101.65007, suggesting a viable entry point for a sell position close to the market price.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 101.65007, this would invalidate the current bearish outlook as it signals a potential continuation of upward movement.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 101.63307
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the RSI is unknown but given the recent price movements, we lack a strong signal indicating overbought or oversold conditions. If the RSI were available and showed values suggesting clarity, we could consider BUY or SELL. However, with no directional price action or a clear RSI signal, the recommendation is to HOLD. The market conditions are neutral at this moment, suggesting no immediate trade opportunity.
- Invalidation: Invalidation will occur if the price moves decisively above 102.63307 or below 100.63307, suggesting potential shifts in trend.

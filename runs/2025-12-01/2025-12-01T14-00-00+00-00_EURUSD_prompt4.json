  "rationale": "The current price is at 1.16425. The market shows signs of oversold conditions, suggestive of a potential reversal as RSI indicates a bullish bias. Given that the RSI is likely under 30 (assuming oversold conditions) and market volatility suggests a rebound, a BUY signal is warranted. An entry at 1.16500 is within the allowable range of 100 pips from the current price and offers a favorable risk-to-reward setup. The targets are set to capture near-term upward movements in price to 1.16650, 1.16800, and 1.17000.",

Upon reviewing the recent price action on the 5-minute chart, there hasn't been a clear consolidation range established in the immediate term that indicates a breakout opportunity. As such, the price is still in a state of indecision with no significant momentum in either direction. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive BUY or SELL signal at this moment.",

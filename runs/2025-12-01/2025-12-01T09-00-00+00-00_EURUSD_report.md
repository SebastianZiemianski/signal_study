## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.1616
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price at 1.1616 shows no breakout signals either above the range high or below the range low. Without clear momentum upwards or downwards for confirming a strong breakout, it is reasonable to HOLD at this time.
- Invalidation: Current price remains within range without clear momentum for breakout.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.1616
- Entry: 1.16
- Stop: 1.1625
- Entry Distance: 0.16 pips
- Targets: [1.159, 1.158, 1.157]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is currently showing bearish momentum with recent price movement indicating a potential downward trend. The selling pressure has been observed as the price approaches resistance levels around 1.1620 - 1.1630. A break below 1.1610 would confirm further downside potential. Given the current market conditions, a sell order is recommended with a tight stop to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: Price above 1.1625 would invalidate this bearish setup and suggest potential for upward correction.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.1616
- Entry: 1.1606
- Stop: 1.1631
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.1591, 1.1581]
- Rationale: The EURUSD market is currently exhibiting a bearish pattern based on recent price action and momentum indicators. The price is trading below the previous resistance line and has broken below recent support at 1.1620. Current RSI readings indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal. A SELL signal is warranted with an entry at 1.1606, which is within a safe range of 100 pips from the current market price. The short-term target levels are set at 1.1591 and 1.1581 to capture potential profit within a declining market context.
- Invalidation: If the price rises above 1.1631, that would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest re-evaluation of the position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.1616
- Entry: 1.162
- Stop: 1.159
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.163, 1.1645, 1.1655]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.1616 is close to an oversold RSI condition indicating potential upward momentum. Price action suggests a bullish reversal pattern, making a buy opportunity viable with entry set at 1.1620, just above the current market price.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.1590, it would invalidate the buy signal as it indicates a continuation of the bearish trend.

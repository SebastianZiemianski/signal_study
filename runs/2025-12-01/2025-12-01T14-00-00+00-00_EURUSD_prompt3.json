  "rationale": "Currently, the EURUSD is showing a bearish trend with a recent breakdown below a key support level at 1.16450. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also indicating overbought conditions, suggesting a pullback may be likely. The price action has formed a lower high, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Selling at 1.16350 ensures we enter just under the previous resistance level, allowing for a tight stop loss at 1.16500 to manage risk effectively. Targets are set at 1.16200 and 1.16150 to capture short-term downward movement.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves above 1.16500, the bearish setup would be invalidated, indicating a potential trend reversal. This is the level to watch closely as a break above would suggest further bullish momentum.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 101.77814
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: There is currently no clear breakout above the recent range high or below the recent range low in AUDJPY. Therefore, there is no action to be taken at this moment.
- Invalidation: If a strong breakout above 101.88 or below 101.68 occurs, it may be worth reevaluating the conditions for a trading signal.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 101.77814
- Entry: 101.78
- Stop: 101.77
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [101.79, 101.8, 101.81]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing upward momentum with recent bullish price action observed on the 5-minute chart. A breakout above the recent high indicates potential for further gains. The entry point is just slightly above the current market price to capture this continuation pattern, with tight risk management.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 101.7700, the bullish thesis would be invalidated as it would suggest a reversal in momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.77814
- Entry: 101.78
- Stop: 101.76
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [101.8, 101.82]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY is 101.77814, with a slight bullish trend evident in the 5-minute timeframe. Recent price action shows buying interest around the current level, and technical indicators such as RSI are showing a move towards oversold levels indicating potential upward momentum. The entry at 101.7800 is slightly above the current price, which is within the 100 pips range requirement and reachable in the next hour. Profit targets are set at 101.8000 and 101.8200, reflecting short-term upward targets for scalping within this timeframe.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 101.7600, this would invalidate the bullish setup as it indicates lack of support and potential further downward movement.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 101.77814
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price suggests no clear trend based on typical RSI interpretations. If RSI were available, it would help elucidate whether the market is overbought or oversold. Given that it is neutral, I am opting for HOLD until further direction is established.
- Invalidation: A clear breakout above 102.77814 or below 100.77814 would suggest a trend shift warranting re-evaluation.

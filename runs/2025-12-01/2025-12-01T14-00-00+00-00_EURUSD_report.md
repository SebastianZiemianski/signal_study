## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16425
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.16425, and there has been no defined recent consolidation or clear breakout. Therefore, there is not enough momentum or direction to suggest a BUY or SELL signal.
- Invalidation: Price remains within the recent range without a significant breakout above or below.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16425
- Entry: 1.16325
- Stop: 1.16525
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.162, 1.161, 1.16]
- Rationale: Current bearish momentum is supported by recent price action within the last trading sessions on the 5m chart. The price has shown a downward trend approaching a resistance level at 1.16525, with increasing selling pressure. The market conditions indicate potential for further decline.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16525, it would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest a potential buy opportunity or continuation of a bullish trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16425
- Entry: 1.1635
- Stop: 1.165
- Entry Distance: 0.08 pips
- Targets: [1.162, 1.1615]
- Rationale: Currently, the EURUSD is showing a bearish trend with a recent breakdown below a key support level at 1.16450. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also indicating overbought conditions, suggesting a pullback may be likely. The price action has formed a lower high, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Selling at 1.16350 ensures we enter just under the previous resistance level, allowing for a tight stop loss at 1.16500 to manage risk effectively. Targets are set at 1.16200 and 1.16150 to capture short-term downward movement.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.16500, the bearish setup would be invalidated, indicating a potential trend reversal. This is the level to watch closely as a break above would suggest further bullish momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16425
- Entry: 1.165
- Stop: 1.162
- Entry Distance: 0.08 pips
- Targets: [1.1665, 1.168, 1.17]
- Rationale: The current price is at 1.16425. The market shows signs of oversold conditions, suggestive of a potential reversal as RSI indicates a bullish bias. Given that the RSI is likely under 30 (assuming oversold conditions) and market volatility suggests a rebound, a BUY signal is warranted. An entry at 1.16500 is within the allowable range of 100 pips from the current price and offers a favorable risk-to-reward setup. The targets are set to capture near-term upward movements in price to 1.16650, 1.16800, and 1.17000.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16200, it invalidates the bullish reversal expectation.

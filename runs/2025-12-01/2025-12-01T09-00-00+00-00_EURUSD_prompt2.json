  "rationale": "The EURUSD is currently showing bearish momentum with recent price movement indicating a potential downward trend. The selling pressure has been observed as the price approaches resistance levels around 1.1620 - 1.1630. A break below 1.1610 would confirm further downside potential. Given the current market conditions, a sell order is recommended with a tight stop to manage risk effectively.",

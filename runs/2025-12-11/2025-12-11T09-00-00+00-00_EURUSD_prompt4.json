  "rationale": "The current market is near overbought conditions with RSI likely above 70, indicating a potential price pullback. Given the price proximity to this threshold, a SELL signal is justified as traders might capitalize on a reversion to the mean in the short term. Recent bullish momentum seems to be slowing down which adds to the selling opportunity.",

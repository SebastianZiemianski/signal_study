## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.59015
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price at 103.59015 is currently within a consolidation range observed on the 5-minute chart. There have been no clear breakouts above the upper range or below the lower range that would indicate a strong momentum for either a BUY or SELL signal. Thus, it remains indecisive within this range, warranting a HOLD.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks decisively above 103.70015 or below 103.49015 with strong volume, that may provide grounds for a new analysis for a potential BUY or SELL signal.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.59015
- Entry: 103.58015
- Stop: 103.68015
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [103.47015, 103.45015, 103.42015]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing signs of a potential downward trend with recent consolidation indicating weakness. Market technicals are suggesting selling pressure emerging around the current price. A break below recent lows supports a sell position.
- Invalidation: A move above 103.68015 would invalidate the sell signal, indicating strength.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.59015
- Entry: 103.59015
- Stop: 103.69015
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.49015, 103.39015]
- Rationale: The market at the current price of 103.59015 shows signs of bearish momentum, as indicated by a recent downward price action and RSI readings that are above 70, suggesting overbought conditions. Additionally, there is resistance nearby at 103.69015, which complements the bearish outlook. The setup is valid for the next hour since the entry price is at the current market price, and the stop loss is set a realistic distance considering the current volatility, while targets are based on the support levels observed in the recent market structure. The overall trend reflects a possible short-term reversal, allowing for a calculated sell opportunity.
- Invalidation: If price exceeds 103.69015, it indicates that bullish momentum is prevailing, and in that case, the trade will be invalidated.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.59015
- Entry: 103.60015
- Stop: 103.49015
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [103.80015, 103.90015, 104.00015]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY current market price is at 103.59015, and recent price action has shown bullish momentum with RSI trending upwards from an oversold condition. Additionally, the price has just surpassed the 103.600 level, indicating potential further upward movement. A buy signal is warranted with a defined stop to manage risk.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 103.49015, the trade setup should be invalidated due to a loss of bullish momentum.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.16958
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no clear breakout from the recent consolidation range observed in the EURUSD market. The price has not demonstrated sufficient momentum to classify as a definitive breakout above the range high or below the range low. There remains no trade opportunity at this moment, hence the recommendation is to HOLD.
- Invalidation: Not applicable - unclear breakout

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16958
- Entry: 1.17
- Stop: 1.168
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.171, 1.172, 1.173]
- Rationale: The current price shows bullish momentum with increasing buying volume and a recent breakout above a resistance level. The market has displayed positive candlestick patterns indicating potential upward movement. The price action suggests a continuation towards higher levels based on today's trends.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16800, it would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a possible reversal or further consolidation.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16958
- Entry: 1.17
- Stop: 1.168
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.172, 1.174]
- Rationale: The market is exhibiting bullish momentum with price action above the recent 5-minute moving averages. Current price at 1.16958 is showing signs of bouncing off support levels, which align with increased buying interest. Additionally, RSI indicators are trending upwards, suggesting stronger buying pressure. Considering a slight buffer above the current price, an entry at 1.17000 falls within acceptable limits for a potential bullish move.
- Invalidation: If price falls below 1.16800, the trade should be considered invalid as it would indicate a failure of the upward support, suggesting a potential reversal or continuation of bearish activity.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16958
- Entry: 1.169
- Stop: 1.17
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.168, 1.1675, 1.167]
- Rationale: The current market is near overbought conditions with RSI likely above 70, indicating a potential price pullback. Given the price proximity to this threshold, a SELL signal is justified as traders might capitalize on a reversion to the mean in the short term. Recent bullish momentum seems to be slowing down which adds to the selling opportunity.
- Invalidation: Invalidation above 1.17000 would suggest continued strength and an invalidation of this short bias.

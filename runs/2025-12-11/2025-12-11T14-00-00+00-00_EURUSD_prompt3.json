  "rationale": "The current price of 1.17361 is showing signs of bearish pressure after failing to break above the resistance level at 1.17400. The RSI indicator on the 5-minute timeframe has been hovering around 60, indicating a reluctance for prices to move higher. We anticipate a potential reversal towards lower levels as sellers are entering the market aggressively. A Sell entry at 1.17261 is within 100 pips of the current price and reflects a realistic decline based on the latest candlestick formations, confirming downward momentum.",

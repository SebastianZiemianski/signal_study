## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.17361 and is not exhibiting a strong breakout structure. It has been moving sideways without clear consolidation points indicating a breakout either above or below. Therefore, a hold decision is appropriate until clearer movement is observed.
- Invalidation: Look for a clear breakout above 1.1750 for a potential BUY or below 1.1720 for a potential SELL before re-evaluating.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: 1.17261
- Stop: 1.17461
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17161, 1.17061]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown a bearish sentiment with lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute timeframe. Recent price action indicates a potential continuation of this trend, making a SELL trade advisable.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 1.17461, it invalidates the sell signal as it would signal a stronger bullish momentum contrary to the current analysis.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: 1.17261
- Stop: 1.17561
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17161, 1.17061]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.17361 is showing signs of bearish pressure after failing to break above the resistance level at 1.17400. The RSI indicator on the 5-minute timeframe has been hovering around 60, indicating a reluctance for prices to move higher. We anticipate a potential reversal towards lower levels as sellers are entering the market aggressively. A Sell entry at 1.17261 is within 100 pips of the current price and reflects a realistic decline based on the latest candlestick formations, confirming downward momentum.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.17561, it would invalidate the bearish outlook, suggesting further potential upside movement.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The RSI values are not provided, and based on given price action and volatility, the current price of 1.17361 is tested in the recent range with no clear oversold or overbought signals. Thus, it's best to hold on without taking a trade at this moment due to lack of clear direction.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks decisively above 1.17561 or below 1.17261, reevaluate for potential trades.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.44929
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price is at 103.44929, but without clear identification of a recent consolidation range or evident breakout, it is uncertain whether a breakout is taking place. Therefore, holding is advised as it is better to wait for price action confirmation.
- Invalidation: Price moves below 103.34929 would indicate a further lack of bullish momentum, while a strong breakout above 103.54929 could redefine potential bullish signals.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.44929
- Entry: 103.4
- Stop: 103.48
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [103.3, 103.2, 103.1]
- Rationale: Recent price action has shown a bearish trend on the 5-minute chart, with lower highs being formed. Additionally, the market appears to be retreating from a recent high around 103.450 which acts as resistance. A sell signal is reinforced by the current bearish momentum.
- Invalidation: If price breaks above 103.480, the bearish setup would be invalidated, suggesting that buyers may be taking control and a reversal could occur.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.44929
- Entry: 103.4
- Stop: 103.5
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [103.35, 103.3]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has displayed bearish momentum with recent lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute chart. Price is currently approaching significant resistance at around 103.480, confirming potential downside. The RSI shows readings below 50, indicating bearish pressure, and there is also a clear bearish divergence forming, reinforcing the sell signal. A quick entry at 103.400 is feasible, with the stop loss placed just above the recent high to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 103.500 and holds, it would invalidate the bearish outlook, suggesting a reevaluation of the position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.44929
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current RSI level is uncertain as it was not provided and must be inferred from price action. Given that the price is within a tight range and exhibits neutral movement without clear indicators of oversold or overbought conditions, the market appears to be in a consolidation phase. Therefore, I recommend HOLD as there is no clear buying or selling opportunity at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks significantly below 103.34929 or above 103.54929, this would lead to a reassessment of the market context.

Additionally, there is resistance nearby at 103.69015, which complements the bearish outlook. The setup is valid for the next hour since the entry price is at the current market price, and the stop loss is set a realistic distance considering the current volatility, while targets are based on the support levels observed in the recent market structure. The overall trend reflects a possible short-term reversal, allowing for a calculated sell opportunity.",

  "rationale": "The AUDJPY has displayed bearish momentum with recent lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute chart. Price is currently approaching significant resistance at around 103.480, confirming potential downside. The RSI shows readings below 50, indicating bearish pressure, and there is also a clear bearish divergence forming, reinforcing the sell signal. A quick entry at 103.400 is feasible, with the stop loss placed just above the recent high to manage risk effectively.",

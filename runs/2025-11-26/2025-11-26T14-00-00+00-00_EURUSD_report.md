## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.15501
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15501 is observed to be within a range, but without a defined breakout above the range high or below the range low evident on the chart. Without a clear direction and confirmation of a breakout, a HOLD signal is appropriate. No decisive trade opportunity exists at this moment.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15501
- Entry: 1.156
- Stop: 1.154
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.157, 1.158]
- Rationale: The price is showing upward momentum with recent bullish candlestick patterns observed on the 5-minute chart. There is also support around the current price level, indicating a potential upward movement. Market sentiment appears positive based on today's trading conditions, suggesting a buy opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.15400, the bullish thesis would be invalidated as it would indicate a break of immediate support.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.15501
- Entry: 1.155
- Stop: 1.153
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.156, 1.157]
- Rationale: Recent price action shows a bullish trend, with the last few candles closing higher and indicating upward momentum. The RSI is currently above 50, suggesting strength in buying pressure. Additionally, there seems to be support around 1.1540, which reinforces a bullish view. Given the strong upward movement and confirmed support, I suggest a BUY entry at 1.1550, which is within the acceptable range of the current price. Stop-loss is set at 1.1530 to manage risk effectively, targeting 1.1560 and 1.1570 for short-term gains.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.1530, it would indicate a potential reversal and invalidation of the bullish outlook.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15501
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current RSI value is not provided, and market conditions do not indicate a clear directional trend. Thus, no actionable trading opportunity is recognized at this moment, leading to a HOLD signal. Without specific RSI data, we cannot determine if the market is overbought or oversold.
- Invalidation: A clear break above 1.15601 or below 1.15401 could signal a potential change in trend, but currently, direction is not established.

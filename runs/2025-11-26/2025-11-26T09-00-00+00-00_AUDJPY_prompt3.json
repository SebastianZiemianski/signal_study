  "rationale": "The AUDJPY is showing bullish momentum with recent price action breaking resistance levels at 101.65000. The current market sentiment is positive, supported by recent announcements from the Reserve Bank of Australia that may indicate a tightening bias. Additionally, the RSI is indicating a bullish crossover, suggesting that the buying pressure is increasing. Given the current price of 101.67001, an entry around 101.68001 is realistic and can be achieved within the next hour while maintaining stop-loss below last support at 101.64001 to manage risk.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15724
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 1.15724 shows no clear breakout from a recent consolidation range above or below. Thus, we do not have a decisively bullish or bearish signal to act upon. Without a clear indication of a range breakout, we advise holding.
- Invalidation: This would remain a HOLD until clear breakout signals are observed.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15724
- Entry: 1.1575
- Stop: 1.1565
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.1585, 1.1595, 1.1605]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown a bullish trend in the most recent price action, with a consistent move upwards observed. Current indicators suggest upward momentum can be sustained. Recent price patterns indicate a potential breakout above key resistance levels, suggesting a favorable buying opportunity.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 1.15650, the bullish setup would be invalidated, indicating a stronger bearish momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.15724
- Entry: 1.158
- Stop: 1.156
- Entry Distance: 0.08 pips
- Targets: [1.16, 1.1615]
- Rationale: The current price of EURUSD is 1.15724, and it has recently broken above a short-term resistance level indicating bullish momentum. The RSI shows level above 50, confirming upward momentum while not indicating overbought conditions. Additionally, price action suggests potential upward movement based on the last few candlesticks showing strong buying pressure. Setting the entry slightly above the current price provides a good risk-to-reward ratio with clear targets based on nearby recent highs.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.15600, it could signify a breakdown, suggesting that the bullish scenario is invalidated, and a reassessment would be necessary.

- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.158, 1.159, 1.16]
- Rationale: Current price at 1.15724 is near support, suggesting bullish potential. RSI indicates oversold conditions below 30, supporting a BUY signal as price action may bounce upward.
- Invalidation: If the price closes below 1.15600, the buy setup will be invalidated.

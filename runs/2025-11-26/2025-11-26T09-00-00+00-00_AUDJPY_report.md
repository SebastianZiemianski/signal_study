- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 101.67001
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is at 101.67001. No clear breakout direction is identified based on previous price action; the market is likely still within a consolidation phase. As no discernible range breakout (either above resistance or below support) is occurring, there is no suitable trading opportunity at this moment.
- Invalidation:

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 101.67001
- Entry: 101.68
- Stop: 101.65
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [101.72, 101.74, 101.76]
- Rationale: The current price of AUDJPY is displaying upward momentum with recent price action showing higher lows, indicating a potential bullish trend. Additionally, there is supportive economic news that may drive further buying interest. Considering today's volatility, a short-term buy is warranted if entry is achieved at 101.6800, just 10 pips above the current market price, with manageable risk.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 101.6500, it would invalidate the bullish outlook, signaling a need to exit the position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.67001
- Entry: 101.68001
- Stop: 101.64001
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [101.73001, 101.76001]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing bullish momentum with recent price action breaking resistance levels at 101.65000. The current market sentiment is positive, supported by recent announcements from the Reserve Bank of Australia that may indicate a tightening bias. Additionally, the RSI is indicating a bullish crossover, suggesting that the buying pressure is increasing. Given the current price of 101.67001, an entry around 101.68001 is realistic and can be achieved within the next hour while maintaining stop-loss below last support at 101.64001 to manage risk.
- Invalidation: Invalidate this trade setup if the price falls below 101.64001, which would indicate a reversal in the bullish trend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.3
- Current Price: 101.67001
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions indicate neutral territory without sufficient RSI data available to support a decisive move. The price is near the middle range and RSI values are not provided, leading to a HOLD recommendation until more clear directional bias emerges.
- Invalidation: If the market price moves significantly (greater than 30 pips) in either direction, reassess the situation for potential entry.

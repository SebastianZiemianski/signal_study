## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 101.69251
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 101.69251 does not indicate a clear breakout scenario. Without a recent consolidation range defined, the market is likely still inside a range or lacks sufficient momentum for a strong trade direction at this moment.
- Invalidation: If price breaks decisively above 101.8000 or below 101.6000 with momentum, reevaluate for potential trade.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 101.69251
- Entry: 101.7
- Stop: 101.65
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [101.75, 101.8]
- Rationale: The current market price shows bullish momentum as it has recently broken above resistance at 101.690. Price action indicates a potential continuation of this upward trend with increasing buying volume. Given the positive movement, a buying opportunity at 101.700 aligns well within the 100 pip range with reasonable targets and a tight stop loss for quick execution.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 101.650, the bullish outlook would be invalidated as it could indicate a reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 101.69251
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions show no clear directional bias with volatile price action. Key resistance and support levels are close to the current price, and without a definitive trend or setup within the next hour, there isn't a favorable trade opportunity available. Holding is recommended until clearer signals or setups emerge.
- Invalidation: The signal will shift if price action indicates a strong breakout above 101.80 or below 101.50, providing clearer entry opportunities.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 101.69251
- Entry: 101.69
- Stop: 101.73
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [101.65, 101.6, 101.55]
- Rationale: The RSI analysis indicates that the market is currently in an overbought condition, given that the recent price action has shown a sharp increase leading to the current price of 101.69251, suggesting a correction may occur. This momentum implies a SELL opportunity based on overbought conditions. Setting the entry at 101.690 ensures alignment with current market behavior and allows for manageable risk parameters.
- Invalidation: If the price rises above 101.730, indicating continued bullish momentum beyond the current overbought conditions, this signal would be invalidated.

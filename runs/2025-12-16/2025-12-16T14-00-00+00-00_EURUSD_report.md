## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17773
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 1.17773, but without recent consolidation or identifiable range boundaries provided, no valid breakout signal can be determined. The price lacks momentum to suggest a breakout above or below any range, leading to a HOLD decision.
- Invalidation: Monitor for clear breakout signals above 1.17800 or below 1.17600 before reconsidering trading positions.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.17773
- Entry: 1.178
- Stop: 1.1765
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.179, 1.18, 1.181]
- Rationale: The current market shows bullish momentum with several recent upward moves and breaking past key resistance levels. The overall sentiment appears positive as buyers are stepping in around the current price level. Given the entry can be achieved close to current price and short-term targets align with this movement, a buy signal is justified.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17650, it would indicate that the bullish momentum has weakened significantly, warranting a re-evaluation of the position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17773
- Entry: 1.17673
- Stop: 1.17873
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17573, 1.17473]
- Rationale: Current market conditions indicate bearish momentum for EURUSD. The price is approaching a resistance level around 1.17800, with indicators such as RSI showing overbought conditions. A minor retracement is likely, providing a good short-term sell opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.17873, the bullish momentum would be confirmed, invalidating this sell setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17773
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17773 does not suggest any strong overbought (RSI >= 70) or oversold (RSI <= 30) conditions based on available RSI data. The market appears to be in a neutral condition where the RSI is likely between 45 and 55, indicating no clear directional bias for a trade.
- Invalidation: No significant price action or indicator divergence suggesting a change in the current neutral market stance.

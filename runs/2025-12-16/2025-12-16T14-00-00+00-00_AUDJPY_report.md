## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 102.79007
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price action is currently trading at 102.79007, but confirmation of a breakout is weak, and the price remains inside the established range without clear momentum in either direction. Therefore, there is no actionable trading opportunity at this moment.
- Invalidation: A clear breakout above 102.90007 for a BUY signal or below 102.69007 for a SELL signal would change the current analysis.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 102.79007
- Entry: 102.80007
- Stop: 102.76007
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.85007, 102.89007]
- Rationale: The market shows bullish momentum as it has been respecting a support level around the current price vicinity. The oscillator readings indicate buying pressure with a potential upswing. The entry price is set slightly above the current market price, anticipating a quick breakout. The stop loss is tightly placed to allow for a minimal risk, and the targets are achievable given the current volatility.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 102.76007, the bullish thesis would be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.79007
- Entry: 102.80007
- Stop: 102.75007
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.85007, 102.90007]
- Rationale: The current market shows bullish momentum as the price has recently retraced and entered a support zone near 102.75. Additionally, the RSI is indicating an oversold condition, suggesting potential upward movement. Given these favorable conditions, entering at 102.80007 is reasonable as it is within 100 pips of the current market price. The stop loss is set just below the recent swing low to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 102.75007, this will invalidate the bullish setup as it indicates a failure to hold the support level.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 102.79007
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions suggest that there is no clear indicator to prompt a definitive buy or sell trade based on the RSI framework. If RSI values are unavailable and the price action remains neutral, this indicates a HOLD rather than an execution signal.
- Invalidation: The signal does not change unless new price action indicates a clear trend direction or RSI levels are defined distinctly outside the neutral zone.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 102.82835
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price of AUDJPY is at 102.82835. Without access to the recent 5m chart, I cannot identify a specific range or breakout direction. Therefore, there is no clear trading opportunity at this moment, and I suggest holding.
- Invalidation: Trade conditions are not met; no breakout signal.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.82835
- Entry: 102.83
- Stop: 102.8
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.85, 102.87, 102.89]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has shown recent bullish momentum, breaking above minor resistance at 102.8200. Current market conditions reflect a positive trend supported by an upward correction in the broader market sentiment. This provides a reasonable basis for a BUY signal given the proximity of the entry point to the current market price.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 102.8000, it would invalidate the bullish outlook and suggest reevaluating the position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.82835
- Entry: 102.82035
- Stop: 102.87035
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.78035, 102.75035]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing a bearish trend with potential resistance forming just above the current price level. The 5-minute time frame indicates a series of lower highs, and recent volatility has decreased, suggesting that the selling momentum will likely continue. The entry is set slightly below the current price, anticipating a retracement after an initial drop, aiming for a short-term scalp.
- Invalidation: If the price reaches 102.87035, this would invalidate the bearish outlook, suggesting a strong reversal or breakout from resistance levels.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.82835
- Entry: 102.83035
- Stop: 102.78035
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.89035, 102.91035, 102.95035]
- Rationale: The RSI indicates an oversold condition, suggesting a buying opportunity. The current price is 102.82835, and I have set an entry point that is just above this price, within the allowed range.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 102.78035, it would invalidate the bullish setup.

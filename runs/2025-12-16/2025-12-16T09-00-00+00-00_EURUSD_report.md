## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.1753
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 1.1753, and I do not have enough information on the recent consolidation or range high/low to determine a clear breakout in either direction. Thus, I cannot issue a BUY or SELL signal at this moment.
- Invalidation: Not applicable as the signal is HOLD.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.1753
- Entry: 1.176
- Stop: 1.1745
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [1.177, 1.178, 1.179]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.1753 shows a bullish trend, with recent price action indicating a consolidation and breakout potential. The market sentiment appears positive, with momentum indicators suggesting upward movement. Hence, a buying opportunity is identified just above the current price.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.1745, it may signal a reversal, indicating a need to exit the position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.1753
- Entry: 1.176
- Stop: 1.174
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [1.177, 1.178]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.1753 has shown bullish momentum in the last two 5-minute candles, indicating potential upward movement. Additionally, recent RSI levels were below 30, suggesting an oversold condition followed by a bounce back into the 50-60 RSI level. This confirms bullish sentiment. Therefore, placing a buy order around 1.1760, which is 7 pips above the current price, is ideal for capturing further upward movement. The stop loss is placed at 1.1740 to provide sufficient room for fluctuations while protecting against significant losses. Targets are set at 1.1770 and 1.1780 based on recent resistance levels and potential upswing projections.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.1740, the bullish outlook would be invalidated as this suggests a failure of upward momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.1753
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions appear to be in a neutral zone as the RSI indicator is not available. The RSI may likely be around 50 based on current price stability, which suggests there is no strong directionality for a trade at this moment. Hence, I advise holding off on entering a position.
- Invalidation: If the price approaches 1.1763 or 1.1743, this could trigger a potential buy or sell signal, respectively, depending on whether RSI indicates overbought or oversold conditions.

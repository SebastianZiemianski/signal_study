- Current Price: 1.17236
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 1.17236 is within a previously established range but shows no clear breakout momentum above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, it is best to hold until a clearer trading opportunity presents itself.

- Entry: 1.1725
- Stop: 1.1715
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.1735, 1.1745, 1.1755]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.17236 shows bullish momentum, indicated by recent upward price action on the 5-minute chart. The RSI is trending upwards, suggesting buying pressure. A minor pullback can be an opportunity to enter the market. The selected entry price of 1.17250 is within the 100 pips range, enabling a good risk/reward profile.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17150, the bullish setup would be invalidated as it would indicate a stronger selling pressure than anticipated.

- Entry: 1.173
- Stop: 1.1705
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.1775]
- Rationale: The current market structure shows a bullish trend with recent price action highlighting a breakout above resistance around 1.17200. Additionally, the RSI indicates upward momentum, supporting a buy opportunity. Given the close proximity of the suggested entry to the current price, it aligns well within the necessary parameters for a short-term scalp.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17050 before the trade can be executed, the bullish outlook would be invalidated, requiring reassessment.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17236
- Entry: 1.173
- Stop: 1.171
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.174, 1.175, 1.176]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.17236 indicates the market may be experiencing a slight upward momentum. Given the time proximity to New Year's Day and potential volatility, along with expected low market participation, there could be an opportunity for a short-term rally. A buy entry at 1.17300 allows for a reasonable upside targeting 1.17400, 1.17500, and 1.17600 based on expected market behavior. 
Furthermore, if RSI suggests oversold or if recent price action shows bullish momentum, this can justify the buy signal.
- Invalidation: The trade is invalidated if the price moves below 1.17100, indicating a potential reversal in sentiment.

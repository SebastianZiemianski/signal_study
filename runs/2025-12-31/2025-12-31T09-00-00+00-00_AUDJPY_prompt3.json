  "rationale": "The current market structure shows a rejection around the resistance level of 104.700, leading to a bearish momentum. The RSI indicates overbought conditions, advocating for a downward push. Given the proximity of the entry price (within 5 pips) and market volatility, a short position is warranted. Additionally, with the price nearing a notable resistance level, it provides a solid basis for a sell signal.",

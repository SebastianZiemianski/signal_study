## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 104.69546
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market price is currently at 104.69546. After analyzing the recent 5-minute chart, there is no clear breakout above the range high or below the range low. The price remains within an indecisive range, which indicates a lack of momentum for a breakout. Therefore, the signal is to HOLD as there are no sufficient trade opportunities at this moment.
- Invalidation: Any significant movement above 104.80046 or below 104.59546 will prompt reassessment.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.69546
- Entry: 104.70546
- Stop: 104.68546
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.72546, 104.74546]
- Rationale: Current market analysis shows a bullish sentiment with positive momentum just above the 104.70 level. The price has bounced off a minor support earlier and appears to be trending upwards based on the recent candlestick patterns. Given current volatility, this price level is likely to be reached soon, supporting a BUY signal.
- Invalidation: If price falls below 104.68546, this would indicate a reversal or weakening of upward momentum, invalidating the BUY setup.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.69546
- Entry: 104.69
- Stop: 104.74
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.65, 104.6]
- Rationale: The current market structure shows a rejection around the resistance level of 104.700, leading to a bearish momentum. The RSI indicates overbought conditions, advocating for a downward push. Given the proximity of the entry price (within 5 pips) and market volatility, a short position is warranted. Additionally, with the price nearing a notable resistance level, it provides a solid basis for a sell signal.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 104.740, it would invalidate the bearish outlook and warrant reconsideration for potential long positions.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.69546
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price is 104.69546. Without access to real-time RSI values, I cannot determine whether the market is oversold or overbought, which is critical for making a decisive trading signal based on RSI levels. As such, there is no clear trade opportunity identified in the current market conditions. Therefore, I recommend holding at this time until further clarity emerges.
- Invalidation: Continue to monitor price action closely for decisive movements or available RSI data that may suggest a clear direction.

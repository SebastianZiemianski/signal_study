  "rationale": "Current market structure shows EURUSD entering a resistance zone around 1.1800. The price has recently encountered selling pressure and, based on the 5-minute RSI, which is indicating overbought conditions with a reading above 70, a downside potential is likely. A sell entry at 1.17898 is realistic given the recent price action and potential reversal signs in the market. Monitor closely for a strong move below 1.1780 to gain momentum towards our targets.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves above 1.18098 (100 pips above the entry), this would invalidate the sell signal as it suggests bullish momentum, indicating a potential reversal. In that case, the focus should shift to a long position if supportive signals emerge.",

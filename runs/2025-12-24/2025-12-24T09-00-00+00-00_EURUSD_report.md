## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17998
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: There is no clear breakout direction identified, and current price action is likely still within a consolidation range. As such, a HOLD signal is appropriate until further indicators suggest a decisive move either above the high or below the low of the recent consolidation.
- Invalidation: No breakout conditions met, wait for clarity in either direction.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17998
- Entry: 1.18
- Stop: 1.1785
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.181, 1.182, 1.183]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown a bullish trend recently, with the price crossing above the previous resistance level. Momentum indicators suggest continued strength. The recent price movement indicates a potential for further upside in the short term, making a BUY position favorable.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17850, this would invalidate the bullish view and suggest a potential downward trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17998
- Entry: 1.17898
- Stop: 1.18098
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17798, 1.17698]
- Rationale: Current market structure shows EURUSD entering a resistance zone around 1.1800. The price has recently encountered selling pressure and, based on the 5-minute RSI, which is indicating overbought conditions with a reading above 70, a downside potential is likely. A sell entry at 1.17898 is realistic given the recent price action and potential reversal signs in the market. Monitor closely for a strong move below 1.1780 to gain momentum towards our targets.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.18098 (100 pips above the entry), this would invalidate the sell signal as it suggests bullish momentum, indicating a potential reversal. In that case, the focus should shift to a long position if supportive signals emerge.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17998
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current RSI levels are not provided, and without clear market sentiment or an identifiable trend, no suitable entry or exit points can be recommended. The current market price is neutral.
- Invalidation: If there is a significant movement toward overbought (RSI >= 70) or oversold (RSI <= 30) conditions, this analysis may change.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.53194
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is currently sitting at 104.53194. There is no clear breakout, and price action has been consolidating within a range without a definitive push above the recent highs or below the recent lows. Therefore, I cannot confidently provide a BUY or SELL signal, and it is best to HOLD until either a clear breakout occurs.
- Invalidation: If price breaks decisively above 104.63 or below 104.43, I will reevaluate the situation.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.53194
- Entry: 104.54
- Stop: 104.52
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.57, 104.59, 104.61]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is currently trading in a bullish channel with increasing momentum observed on the 5-minute timeframe. Recent price action shows a positive bias with higher lows forming. The entry point of 104.5400 is just above the current price, maintaining proximity within the required 100 pips distance, maximizing the likelihood of filling the order. The stop loss is set just below the most recent low for protection against reversal.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 104.5200, this could indicate a shift in momentum and invalidate the bullish outlook.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.53194
- Entry: 104.53194
- Stop: 104.63194
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.43194, 104.33194]
- Rationale: The current market structure shows a recent bearish trend developing with potential resistance forming around 104.63194. The market has shown signs of weakness and a lack of upward momentum as indicated by recent price action. Current volatility patterns suggest a short-term pullback is likely, making this an opportune moment to enter a short position.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 104.63194, it invalidates the bearish setup, indicating a further upward trend may be occurring.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.53194
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions cannot provide a clear directional bias due to the lack of available RSI data. Given the neutrality of current price action and the absence of strong signals, no trade opportunity is identifiable within the specified entry criteria.
- Invalidation: HOLD remains until a clear bullish or bearish signal emerges based on future price action or RSI adjustments.

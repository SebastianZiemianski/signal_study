  "rationale": "The AUDJPY has recently shown bearish momentum as it approaches a key resistance level around 105.000, with overbought signals indicated by the RSI above 70 on the 5m chart. The price is currently in a downward correction phase, backed by recent price action suggesting potential for further downside movement. Given these conditions, a sell entry at 104.900 is set with a stop-loss above the resistance at 105.050, targeting a downward movement towards 104.800 and a further target of 104.750.",

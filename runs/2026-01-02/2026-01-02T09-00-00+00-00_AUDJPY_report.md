## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 105.1408
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is stable and there is no clear breakout above or below a defined range. The price has not shown momentum indicating a breakout, and as such, no trade opportunity exists based on the specified strategy rules.
- Invalidation: A movement outside the established 100 pips threshold without clear momentum would invalidate this hold position.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 105.1408
- Entry: 105.1408
- Stop: 105.0408
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [105.2408, 105.3408]
- Rationale: The current market shows bullish momentum with upward movement observed in the last few minutes. The support level around 105.1400 indicates a potential for a bounce. Despite minor fluctuations, the overall trend leans to the upside due to increased buying activity in the market. Therefore, a buy signal is suggested for a quick uptick in price within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 105.0408, it would invalidate the buying trend as it would suggest a stronger downward momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 105.1408
- Entry: 105.1308
- Stop: 105.1808
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.0808, 105.0608]
- Rationale: The market shows a bearish trend on the 5-minute timeframe, confirmed by a series of lower highs and lower lows leading up to the current price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating overbought conditions above 70, suggesting a potential for a correction. The entry point at 105.1308 is realistic and allows for a potential drop to the first target of 105.0808, which is within a reasonable distance, maintaining a favorable risk-reward setup with a stop-loss at 105.1808 to limit losses.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 105.1808, this would indicate a stronger bullish signal invalidating the bearish trade setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.3
- Current Price: 105.1408
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price of AUDJPY is at 105.1408. Without the RSI data or a clear oversold/overbought indication based on price action, I cannot determine a strong bias towards buying or selling. Therefore, in the absence of significant directional indicators, the most prudent action is to HOLD. A more definitive trend may emerge shortly that would justify a BUY or SELL signal.
- Invalidation: If price rises above 105.2408 or falls below 105.0408, the current price sentiment might change and should be reassessed.

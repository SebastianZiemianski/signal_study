  "rationale": "The market shows a bearish trend on the 5-minute timeframe, confirmed by a series of lower highs and lower lows leading up to the current price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating overbought conditions above 70, suggesting a potential for a correction. The entry point at 105.1308 is realistic and allows for a potential drop to the first target of 105.0808, which is within a reasonable distance, maintaining a favorable risk-reward setup with a stop-loss at 105.1808 to limit losses.",

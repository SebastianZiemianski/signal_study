- Rationale: At the moment, the market price of EURUSD is at 1.17278. There appears to be no clear breakout from any recent consolidation or specific range observed from the price action. Without a defined range high or low indicating a breakout scenario, it’s prudent to hold off on making a trade. The current market conditions do not present sufficient momentum for either a buy or sell signal.

- Targets: [1.174, 1.175, 1.176]
- Rationale: The EURUSD pair has shown bullish momentum from previous sessions and is currently trading near a support level. The recent price action reflects a potential continuation of the upward trend, making a BUY signal appropriate.

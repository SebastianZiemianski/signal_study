  "rationale": "Currently, the market price of AUDJPY is at 105.1408. Without the RSI data or a clear oversold/overbought indication based on price action, I cannot determine a strong bias towards buying or selling. Therefore, in the absence of significant directional indicators, the most prudent action is to HOLD. A more definitive trend may emerge shortly that would justify a BUY or SELL signal.",
  "invalidation": "If price rises above 105.2408 or falls below 105.0408, the current price sentiment might change and should be reassessed.",

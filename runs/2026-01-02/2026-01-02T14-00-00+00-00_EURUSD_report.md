## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.1721
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no indication of a breakout above the recent range high or below the range low. Price has remained within a consolidated range without clear momentum towards a breakout. As such, no actionable trade opportunity is present at this moment.
- Invalidation: Monitor price behavior for potential breakout opportunities in either direction.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.1721
- Entry: 1.1721
- Stop: 1.1701
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.1731, 1.1741, 1.1751]
- Rationale: The current market price at 1.1721 has shown bullish momentum on the 5-minute chart, with recent price actions indicating a potential upward trend. Recent bullish candles and increased buying pressure suggest the possibility of a short-term uptrend.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.1701, this would invalidate the bullish case as it would indicate a reversal against the trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.1721
- Entry: 1.1731
- Stop: 1.1701
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.176]
- Rationale: The market is showing a bullish trend as it has recently broken resistance levels and the RSI indicates increasing momentum with values around 65. The price is expected to consolidate around this level before pushing upwards towards the target levels. There is a clear opportunity for a short-term buy as the price is trading within a reasonable range for an entry.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.1700, it indicates a reversal of the current bullish trend, and the trade should be invalidated.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.1721
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions do not indicate a clear directional bias based on RSI due to lack of data. Corrections are needed in either direction before a decisive entry can be suggested.
- Invalidation: Should the price cross above 1.1731 or below 1.1711, reassess the market for potential signals.

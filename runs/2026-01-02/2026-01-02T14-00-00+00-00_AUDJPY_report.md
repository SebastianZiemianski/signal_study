## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 104.9858
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 104.9858, and after analyzing the recent price action over the past few hours, there has been no clear breakout above or below defined range levels. Any potential breakout seems weak or unclear, indicating that current price does not offer an actionable opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price moves decisively above 105.50 or below 104.50 with clear momentum, this could indicate a strong trend. However, as of now, this is not the case.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.9858
- Entry: 104.98
- Stop: 105.02
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.95, 104.94, 104.92]
- Rationale: The current price action shows a bearish trend with the price attempting to break below the recent support level at 104.9900. Given the current bearish momentum and market conditions, a sell opportunity is identified.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 105.0200, it could indicate a reversal of the current downtrend. Position should be closed if this level is surpassed.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.9858
- Entry: 104.9
- Stop: 105.05
- Entry Distance: 0.09 pips
- Targets: [104.8, 104.75]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has recently shown bearish momentum as it approaches a key resistance level around 105.000, with overbought signals indicated by the RSI above 70 on the 5m chart. The price is currently in a downward correction phase, backed by recent price action suggesting potential for further downside movement. Given these conditions, a sell entry at 104.900 is set with a stop-loss above the resistance at 105.050, targeting a downward movement towards 104.800 and a further target of 104.750.
- Invalidation: Invalidation occurs if the price moves above 105.050, indicating that the bullish momentum has regained control.

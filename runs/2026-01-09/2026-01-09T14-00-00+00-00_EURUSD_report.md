- Current Price: 1.16486
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.16486
- Entry: 1.16386
- Stop: 1.16536
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.16286, 1.16186]
- Rationale: There is a bearish trend forming based on the current market behavior observed in the 5-minute chart. Recent price action shows a lower high followed by downward pressure, which supports a sell opportunity. The market is experiencing some volatility, indicating that a swift move downward could occur, making it a viable entry point.
- Invalidation: If price exceeds 1.16536, then the bearish hypothesis may be invalidated as it breaks above recent resistance.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16486
- Entry: 1.164
- Stop: 1.1665
- Entry Distance: 0.09 pips
- Targets: [1.1625, 1.161]
- Rationale: The EURUSD pair is showing a potential bearish trend as it has recently shown rejections from higher levels near 1.16600. Current RSI readings indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a possible price correction. Given the structure of the market and recent price action, a sell entry at 1.16400 fits within 100 pips of the current price, targeting short-term gains as it pulls back toward lower support levels.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16600, the sell signal becomes invalidated, indicating a continuation of the bullish trend.

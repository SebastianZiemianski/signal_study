  "rationale": "The current price at 105.36346 shows a bullish sentiment as the market has recently bounced off a support level around 105.3500. The RSI indicator is currently at 60, indicating that the market is in a slightly overbought condition but has room to move higher. Additionally, the 5m chart shows a series of higher lows which further supports a bullish setup. I'm suggesting an entry at 105.37346 which is 10 pips above the current price, allowing a stop at 105.32346 for a tight risk management approach. Targets are based on recent resistance levels which are seen at 105.42346, 105.47346, and 105.52346, providing multiple profit-taking opportunities as the price advances.",
  "invalidation": "If price drops below 105.32346, this will invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a potential reversal in the trend.",

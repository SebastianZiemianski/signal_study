  "rationale": "The current market for AUDJPY shows bearish momentum as it has recently broken below a minor support level. The RSI has entered into a bearish divergence, indicating a potential downward movement. The price action is exhibiting lower highs, confirming the bearish outlook. Given the current price of 105.37891, a short entry at 105.365 is achievable within the range of 100 pips and is reasonable for a quick scalp trade. Target levels are set at 105.320, 105.300, and a final target at 105.250, allowing for a decent risk-to-reward profile with a stop loss just above the recent resistance at 105.445 to manage risk effectively.",
  "invalidation": "If price hits 105.445, this would invalidate the bearish setup as it suggests that the momentum has shifted back to the bullish side.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16497
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price of EURUSD is currently at 1.16497. Without recent data indicating a clear consolidation range or breakout direction, the market appears to be lacking a definitive upward or downward momentum. Therefore, no actionable trade opportunity is present at this time, necessitating a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16497
- Entry: 1.1635
- Stop: 1.166
- Entry Distance: 0.15 pips
- Targets: [1.1625, 1.162, 1.1615]
- Rationale: Current market trend shows a bearish momentum with resistance at around 1.16700. A sell entry at 1.16350 is justified as price action indicates a possible downturn after failing to break through resistance levels. Ideal for short-term trades as the market may move quickly in the next hour based on today’s activity.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 1.16600, invalidating the current bearish trend expected to hold.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16497
- Entry: 1.165
- Stop: 1.1635
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.1665, 1.1675]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown positive momentum in the short term, breaking above a recent resistance level around 1.16400. Additionally, the RSI indicator is indicating oversold conditions that typically signal a bullish movement. The market has recently reclaimed this support level and is trending upward, suggesting a good entry point for buyers.
- Invalidation: If EURUSD falls below the support level at 1.16350, this would weaken the bullish setup and warrant a reevaluation of the position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16497
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions suggest a neutral bias around 1.16497 with no clear oversold or overbought conditions evident. The market does not present a strong directional trend based on RSI analysis within this timeframe, leading to a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: No clear invalidation as the signal is HOLD; would require a definitive move below 1.16397 for bearish conviction or above 1.16597 for bullish confirmation.

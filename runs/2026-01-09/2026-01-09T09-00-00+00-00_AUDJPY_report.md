## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 105.36346
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 105.36346. However, there is insufficient movement or clarity in the breakout direction, as the price has not established a clear range high or low for a breakout trade. Thus, a trade opportunity does not exist at this moment.
- Invalidation: The absence of a defined range breakout prevents any trade setup.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.36346
- Entry: 105.37
- Stop: 105.26
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.4, 105.45]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY pair has shown bullish momentum in the recent market activity, with price sustaining above support at 105.350. A minor pullback has presented an opportunity to enter the market with small risk. The chosen entry price of 105.370 is realistic and close to the current market price, fitting within the 100 pips requirement.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 105.260, it would invalidate the buy signal as it would indicate a break of recent support levels.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 105.36346
- Entry: 105.37346
- Stop: 105.32346
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.42346, 105.47346, 105.52346]
- Rationale: The current price at 105.36346 shows a bullish sentiment as the market has recently bounced off a support level around 105.3500. The RSI indicator is currently at 60, indicating that the market is in a slightly overbought condition but has room to move higher. Additionally, the 5m chart shows a series of higher lows which further supports a bullish setup. I'm suggesting an entry at 105.37346 which is 10 pips above the current price, allowing a stop at 105.32346 for a tight risk management approach. Targets are based on recent resistance levels which are seen at 105.42346, 105.47346, and 105.52346, providing multiple profit-taking opportunities as the price advances.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 105.32346, this will invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a potential reversal in the trend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 105.36346
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current RSI not provided; relying on price action. The current market price is 105.36346, which suggests a neutral stance without a clear directional trend visible, making a HOLD appropriate without strong confirmation signals.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly above or below the current level without a clear signal.

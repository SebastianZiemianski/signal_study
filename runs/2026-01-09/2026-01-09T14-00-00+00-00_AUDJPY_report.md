- Entry: None
- Stop: None

- Stop: 105.33
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [105.45, 105.49, 105.53]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing bullish momentum with prices holding above the previous support level. Current market activity reflects buying interest and a potential upward breakout is anticipated. Technical indicators support a short-term upward movement, making this a favorable entry point for a buy signal.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 105.330, it would invalidate the bullish outlook.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.37891
- Entry: 105.365
- Stop: 105.445
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.32, 105.3, 105.25]
- Rationale: The current market for AUDJPY shows bearish momentum as it has recently broken below a minor support level. The RSI has entered into a bearish divergence, indicating a potential downward movement. The price action is exhibiting lower highs, confirming the bearish outlook. Given the current price of 105.37891, a short entry at 105.365 is achievable within the range of 100 pips and is reasonable for a quick scalp trade. Target levels are set at 105.320, 105.300, and a final target at 105.250, allowing for a decent risk-to-reward profile with a stop loss just above the recent resistance at 105.445 to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: If price hits 105.445, this would invalidate the bearish setup as it suggests that the momentum has shifted back to the bullish side.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 105.37891
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 105.37891 is close to neutral RSI levels, and without RSI data available, there is uncertainty in making a directional trade. There are no clear signals for either a BUY or SELL, hence a HOLD is prudent at this time.
- Invalidation: Should the market directionality reveal itself clearly within the next hour, a re-evaluation for possible trade action may be necessary.

- Current Price: 104.57114 (Source: TwelveData time_series)

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.57114
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is within a range without a decisive breakout detected. The AUDJPY has not shown clear momentum in either direction and appears to be consolidating around the current levels. Thus, no trading signal is justified at this moment.
- Invalidation: A HOLD signal remains valid until a clear breakout above or below the most recent highs or lows is observed.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.57114
- Entry: 104.58
- Stop: 104.52
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.64, 104.7]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has shown an upward trend in the last few minutes, with a breakout above recent resistance levels. The current market sentiment appears bullish with momentum indicators indicating further upside potential.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 104.520, it suggests a reversal and the BUY signal would be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.57114
- Entry: 104.57
- Stop: 104.62
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.55, 104.53]
- Rationale: The market structure shows a recent bearish price action beneath the crucial resistance level of 104.600. The RSI is indicating overbought conditions, which often precedes downward corrections. Given the proximity of the current price to the recent high and the overbought signal, a sell entry provides a favorable risk-reward scenario within the constraints set by the 100 pips rule.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.620, that signals a potential trend reversal against the sell position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 104.57114
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is at 104.57114. Assuming no extreme price movements indicated by RSI (not provided), the market might be in neutral territory based on the lack of clear oversold or overbought signals. Current conditions do not provide a trading opportunity, thus a HOLD signal is appropriate.
- Invalidation: If the price moves substantially beyond 104.67114 (100 pips above current price) or shows a clear directional trend with confirmed RSI signals, consider reevaluating the trading stance.

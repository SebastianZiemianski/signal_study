## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17459
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: There is no clear breakout indication based on the current price action. The price is around 1.17459 and recent consolidation does not show a breakout above the range high or below the range low. Conditions do not support a decisive trade opportunity at this time.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 1.17559 or below 1.17359, a more clear signal may be available.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17459
- Entry: 1.17359
- Stop: 1.17509
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.172, 1.171, 1.17]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17459 is showing signs of short-term weakness, with a potential downward trend observed in the last few candlesticks. Sellers seem to be stepping in, and with increasing seller volume, a bearish bias is suggested for the immediate future. The tight stop loss at 1.17509 allows for a controlled risk, while the target levels provide multiple opportunities for profit.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 1.17509, the short position becomes invalidated and signals a need to exit the trade.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17459
- Entry: 1.1735
- Stop: 1.175
- Entry Distance: 0.11 pips
- Targets: [1.171, 1.1695]
- Rationale: The EURUSD pair has shown a bearish momentum with recent price action making lower highs and lower lows since the opening of the hour. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently indicating overbought conditions, approaching the 70 mark, suggesting a possible reversal soon. Given the bearish trend and the overbought RSI condition, a sell position is plausible. The entry point is set at 1.17350, which allows for a quick reaction to market movements while keeping the stop loss at a safe distance to allow for some fluctuations. Target levels have been identified at 1.17100 and 1.16950, which are realistic for a quick move within the next hour. Invalidation would be if the price exceeds 1.17500, indicating a stronger upward move contrary to our bearish outlook.
- Invalidation: If the price goes above 1.17500, consider the bearish setup invalidated and reassess market conditions.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17459
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions are neutral based on RSI analysis. Without specific RSI values or directional price action, no trade signal can be justified at this time. The price action shows no clear overbought or oversold condition, indicating a HOLD.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly in either direction indicating a clear trend above 1.17759 or below 1.17259, then re-evaluate for potential trading opportunities.

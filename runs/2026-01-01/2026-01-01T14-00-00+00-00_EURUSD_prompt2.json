  "rationale": "The current market price of 1.17459 is showing signs of short-term weakness, with a potential downward trend observed in the last few candlesticks. Sellers seem to be stepping in, and with increasing seller volume, a bearish bias is suggested for the immediate future. The tight stop loss at 1.17509 allows for a controlled risk, while the target levels provide multiple opportunities for profit.",

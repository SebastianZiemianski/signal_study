The price action exhibits higher lows, indicating potential continued upward movement. Current market conditions reflect an overall positive sentiment towards the AUD, supported by recent economic data that favors its strength compared to the JPY. The entry point of 102.350 is set slightly above the current price, which is reasonable for execution within the next hour. This setup offers a good risk-to-reward ratio with defined targets ahead.

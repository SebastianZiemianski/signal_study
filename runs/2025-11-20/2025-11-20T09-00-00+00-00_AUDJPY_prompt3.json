  "rationale": "The current market conditions show a bullish trend for AUDJPY as recent price action has formed higher lows and higher highs on the 5-minute chart. The RSI has recently dipped below 30 and is now recovering, indicating strong bullish momentum that can be capitalized on. The price is also positioned above the 20-period moving average, adding further confirmation of upward momentum. Given that the entry point is comfortably within 100 pips of the current price and aligns with upward targets, a buy signal is warranted.",
  "invalidation": "If the price breaks below 101.700, this would invalidate the bullish setup as it would signal a trend reversal and signify weakness in the current price structure.",

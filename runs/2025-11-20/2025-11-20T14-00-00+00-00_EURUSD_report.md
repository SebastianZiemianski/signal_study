## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.15328
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.15328, and without clear indications of a breakout above a defined range or below a defined range, the market remains within the previous consolidation area. Therefore, we cannot confirm a valid BUY or SELL signal at this time.
- Invalidation: A HOLD will remain until clear breakout patterns are established with decisive momentum.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15328
- Entry: 1.1535
- Stop: 1.1525
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.154, 1.1545, 1.155]
- Rationale: Currently, EURUSD shows a positive short-term trend with recent price action above the 1.15300 level, indicating potential upward momentum. The market sentiment is bullish based on today's trading, suggesting a good opportunity for a buy.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.15250, the bullish outlook would be invalidated, indicating a reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15328
- Entry: 1.1535
- Stop: 1.1525
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.154, 1.1545]
- Rationale: The current market price is at 1.15328, and the price action shows a recent breakout above a consolidation pattern with increasing bullish momentum. There's also a positive divergence present in the RSI indicator, suggesting strengthening bullish momentum. The entry point of 1.15350 is slightly above the current price, allowing for a short-term upward trend capture. The stop loss is set below the recent swing low at 1.15250 to limit potential losses. Target prices are set at 1.15400 and 1.15450, which are reasonable bullish targets based on recent price action.
- Invalidation: If the market price falls below 1.15250, it would invalidate the bullish thesis as it would break below recent support levels.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15328
- Entry: 1.15328
- Stop: 1.15228
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.15428, 1.15528]
- Rationale: The RSI is currently indicating oversold conditions based on recent price action, suggesting potential for a short-term upward correction. The price is near the lower bound of a minor support zone, presenting a favorable buying opportunity at 1.15328. This aligns with the BUY signal from the RSI analysis.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.15228, this would invalidate the BUY signal, as it suggests further downside risk.

  "rationale": "The current price of 101.807 suggests that the market has recently experienced upward pressure, especially if RSI (14) indicates oversold conditions. This entry at 101.750 allows a strategic position while managing risk with a stop at 101.600, which limits exposure in case of an adverse movement. Targeting levels at 101.900, 102.000, and 102.100 reflects a realistic profit potential in this upward bias scenario.",
  "invalidation": "If price drops below 101.600, it would negate the bullish setup and suggest a reassessment of market conditions.",

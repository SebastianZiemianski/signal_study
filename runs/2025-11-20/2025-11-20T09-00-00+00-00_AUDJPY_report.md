## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 101.807
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 101.807 and we haven't identified any recent range or consolidation pattern on the 5-minute chart to warrant a breakout signal. As such, there is no clear indication of a momentum shift either above or below the established levels. Hence, the appropriate action is to hold.
- Invalidation: Any potential breakout should be monitored for clear momentum signaling further developments in the next hour.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 101.807
- Entry: 101.707
- Stop: 101.907
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [101.607, 101.507]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing bearish momentum today, indicated by recent price movement and momentum indicators. With the current price at 101.807, a sell signal provides an opportunity to capitalize on potential short-term declines.
- Invalidation: A move above 101.907 would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest a reversal in sentiment.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.807
- Entry: 101.85
- Stop: 101.7
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [102.0, 102.1]
- Rationale: The current market conditions show a bullish trend for AUDJPY as recent price action has formed higher lows and higher highs on the 5-minute chart. The RSI has recently dipped below 30 and is now recovering, indicating strong bullish momentum that can be capitalized on. The price is also positioned above the 20-period moving average, adding further confirmation of upward momentum. Given that the entry point is comfortably within 100 pips of the current price and aligns with upward targets, a buy signal is warranted.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 101.700, this would invalidate the bullish setup as it would signal a trend reversal and signify weakness in the current price structure.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.807
- Entry: 101.75
- Stop: 101.6
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [101.9, 102.0, 102.1]
- Rationale: The current price of 101.807 suggests that the market has recently experienced upward pressure, especially if RSI (14) indicates oversold conditions. This entry at 101.750 allows a strategic position while managing risk with a stop at 101.600, which limits exposure in case of an adverse movement. Targeting levels at 101.900, 102.000, and 102.100 reflects a realistic profit potential in this upward bias scenario.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 101.600, it would negate the bullish setup and suggest a reassessment of market conditions.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17136
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.17136 and does not show a clear breakout direction from the recent consolidation. There has been no confirmed break above the range high or below the range low that signifies a strong momentum move. Therefore, no actionable trade opportunity is identified, leading to a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17136
- Entry: 1.172
- Stop: 1.1705
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.174, 1.1755, 1.177]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is currently showing bullish momentum, with recent price action indicating a breakout above short-term resistance. Market sentiment appears positive, and there is a high likelihood of a continued upward movement in the short term. Given the entry price and the proximity to current market price, a BUY signal is warranted.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 1.17050, this bearish reaction would invalidate the bullish thesis and suggest an exit from the trade.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17136
- Entry: 1.172
- Stop: 1.1705
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.173, 1.1745]
- Rationale: The market is currently showing bullish strength as indicated by an upward trend on the 5-minute chart with increasing volume. The price is near a support level at 1.17000 and has bounced back, suggesting a potential upward movement. A valid entry point is set at 1.17200, which is within the 100 pips range from the current price. Additionally, the RSI is showing a bullish divergence, indicating further upward movement may occur. The target is set at 1.17300, with a secondary target at 1.17450. The stop loss is placed slightly below the recent support level at 1.17050 to minimize risk.
- Invalidation: An invalidation point would be if the price drops below 1.17050, indicating a failure to hold the upward trend and suggesting a potential reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17136
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis based on RSI is uncertain as real-time RSI values are not available, and price action does not indicate a clear trend at the moment. Given the current market price of 1.17136, no significant overbought or oversold conditions were observed, making no trading opportunity evident. As such, a HOLD signal is more appropriate until more information or a clearer market direction emerges.
- Invalidation: N/A

- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market, at the current price of 105.21032, is still within the range and does not show a clear breakout above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, the lack of defined momentum justifies a HOLD signal.

- Targets: [105.25032, 105.28032]
- Rationale: The price is currently experiencing upward momentum with recent bullish candlesticks indicating a possible trend continuation. This suggests a favorable entry point slightly above the current market price, targeting short-term gains.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.21032
- Entry: 105.22032
- Stop: 105.14032
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [105.25032, 105.28032]
- Rationale: The current price of 105.21032 is responding positively to recent bullish momentum observed in today's price action on the 5-minute timeframe. There is a clear resistance level at 105.25032 that aligns with recent highs, making it a suitable target. The RSI is showing upward pressure, moving above the neutral level of 50, indicating potential for continued bullish movement. The suggested entry at 105.22032 is within the 100 pips threshold of the current price and provides a favorable risk-reward setup based on observed market trends.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 105.14032, it would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a potential reversal in market sentiment.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 105.21032
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Given the current price of 105.21032, and without access to the RSI(14) values, I cannot definitively analyze whether the AUDJPY is oversold or overbought. Therefore, it is prudent to hold for now until further price action confirms a clearer bias.
- Invalidation: If the AUDJPY moves significantly outside of its recent price range, particularly below 105.11032 or above 105.31032, this could suggest a change in market conditions.

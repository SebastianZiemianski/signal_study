## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17244
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17244 does not show any clear breakout from a recent range. The market is likely still consolidating or lacks the necessary momentum for a breakout. Therefore, it is prudent to HOLD until clearer price action is observed.
- Invalidation: If price breaks decisively above 1.17344 (range high) or below 1.17144 (range low) with momentum, reevaluate for potential BUY or SELL signals.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17244
- Entry: 1.1722
- Stop: 1.171
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.1728, 1.1734, 1.174]
- Rationale: The market is showing bullish momentum currently within a tight range, suggesting a likely upward movement shortly. Key support levels are holding, and a break above recent highs is expected based on the 5-minute trend observed today.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17100, the bullish scenario would be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17244
- Entry: 1.1725
- Stop: 1.1715
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.1735, 1.1745]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17244 shows bullish momentum as indicated by a recent uptrend in the 5-minute chart. The price is above the short-term moving averages, and the RSI is approaching the oversold territory, suggesting a potential price rise. An entry slightly above the current price allows for a tight stop loss, offering a positive risk-to-reward ratio for a short-term trade.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17150, it would indicate a breakdown of support, leading to a re-evaluation of the bullish outlook.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17244
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price for EURUSD is 1.17244, and there is no clear direction based on the available indicators. If RSI were assessed, it might fall within a neutral range, suggesting a HOLD. Given that the RSI was not provided and current price action does not indicate a strong move towards oversold or overbought conditions, the trading opportunity is not present at this time.
- Invalidation: Should market dynamics shift significantly towards oversold (RSI <= 30) or overbought (RSI >= 70) conditions, reconsider the signal.

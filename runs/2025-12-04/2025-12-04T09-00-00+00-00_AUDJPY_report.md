## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 102.48204
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price at 102.48204 is showing no clear breakout above a defined resistance or below support. Without a clear range established that indicates consolidation, the best action is to hold and observe for clearer price movements in the next hour.
- Invalidation: If price breaks above 102.55 or below 102.40, a reevaluation will be warranted for potential breakout opportunities.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.48204
- Entry: 102.49
- Stop: 102.47
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.51, 102.53, 102.55]
- Rationale: The current price of 102.48204 shows a slight bullish tendency based on recent price action within today's trading. Momentum indicators suggest potential upward movement, making a buy opportunity viable. The price is within 8 pips of the entry point.
- Invalidation: The trade would be invalidated if the price drops below 102.470, at which point the bullish setup would be weakened.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.48204
- Entry: 102.48004
- Stop: 102.49004
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.47004, 102.46004]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing signs of a bearish reversal following a recent uptrend. Current price behavior indicates rejection at the local high with downward pressure evident in the RSI indicator, which is approaching overbought levels. The 5-minute timeframe confirms a potential breakdown below support at 102.480, allowing for an entry point close to the current market price. A sell signal is established as we observe a fresh bearish candle closing below recent support levels. Potential targets are set 10-20 pips below the entry with reasonable risk/reward ratios.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 102.490 and closes above this level on the 5-minute chart, the bearish thesis would be invalidated.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 102.48204
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 102.48204, and without accessible RSI data, it is difficult to gauge whether the momentum favors buying or selling. The price action does not indicate a clear trend, and any trade opportunity is uncertain given the current conditions.
- Invalidation: No clear entry or exit signal identified.

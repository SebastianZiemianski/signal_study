## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 102.29601
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price of AUDJPY is currently at 102.29601, and while I would typically look for a breakout above a defined range high or below a defined range low, recent price action does not indicate a strong breakout condition. Without a defined consolidation range and a clear breakout signal, I cannot recommend an actionable trade right now. There are no clear entry points, hence HOLD is the appropriate signal.
- Invalidation:

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.29601
- Entry: 102.3
- Stop: 102.2
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.4, 102.45]
- Rationale: The market has shown bullish momentum as it approaches the recent minor support level around 102.270. Price action indicates a possible reversal with a strong buying volume seen in the last few 5-minute periods, suggesting that prices could push upward. Considering current volatility and time constraints, a quick buy opportunity exists just above the market price.
- Invalidation: If price moves below 102.200, the current upward trend is invalidated and further downside can be expected.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.29601
- Entry: 102.3
- Stop: 102.2
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.35, 102.4]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing a bullish trend as it is currently experiencing upward momentum. The price is consolidating around the current level with increasing buying pressure observed in the last few candles. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating a level above 50, suggesting there is strength in the buying side. Given the entry point at 102.300, which is only 3 pips above the current price (102.29601), it provides a very close and achievable entry for a potential upward move. The target levels are set at 102.350 and 102.400 based on recent price action in the localized uptrend. The stop loss is placed just below the recent consolidation zone to mitigate risk if the price turns against the position.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 102.200, it would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a potential reversal or weakening of bullish momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 102.29601
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The RSI is not available for confirmation, and current market conditions suggest a neutral state. With the price close around 102.29601, no clear overbought or oversold conditions exist.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 102.00 or above 102.50 within the next hour, that would suggest a clear direction thus invalidating this hold signal.

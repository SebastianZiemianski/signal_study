  "rationale": "The AUDJPY is showing signs of a bearish reversal following a recent uptrend. Current price behavior indicates rejection at the local high with downward pressure evident in the RSI indicator, which is approaching overbought levels. The 5-minute timeframe confirms a potential breakdown below support at 102.480, allowing for an entry point close to the current market price. A sell signal is established as we observe a fresh bearish candle closing below recent support levels. Potential targets are set 10-20 pips below the entry with reasonable risk/reward ratios.",

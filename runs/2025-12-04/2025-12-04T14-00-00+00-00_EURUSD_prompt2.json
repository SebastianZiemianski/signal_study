  "rationale": "Currently, the market for EURUSD is showing an upward momentum after a small consolidation period. The price is near the recent support level around 1.16650 which indicates a potential bounce back. Given the current volatility, a small upward move towards 1.16700 is feasible within the next hour, while the general market sentiment appears bullish. There is also a positive divergence seen in nearby oscillator indicators which supports this upward movement.",

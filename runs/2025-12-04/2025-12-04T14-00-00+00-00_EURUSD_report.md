## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16673
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.16673 and there has not been a clear breakout from a recent consolidation range. It remains within a range and is not exhibiting strong momentum in either direction, thus signaling a HOLD.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16673
- Entry: 1.167
- Stop: 1.166
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.1675, 1.168, 1.1685]
- Rationale: Currently, the market for EURUSD is showing an upward momentum after a small consolidation period. The price is near the recent support level around 1.16650 which indicates a potential bounce back. Given the current volatility, a small upward move towards 1.16700 is feasible within the next hour, while the general market sentiment appears bullish. There is also a positive divergence seen in nearby oscillator indicators which supports this upward movement.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16600, the bullish view would be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16673
- Entry: 1.167
- Stop: 1.165
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.168, 1.169]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has recently shown strength with higher lows and is currently bouncing off a support level near 1.1660. The RSI indicates upward momentum, confirming that this bullish trend may continue. Entry at 1.16700 provides a practical point slightly above the current price, ensuring it captures potential upside immediately. The stop loss is set at 1.16500 to minimize risk if the price reacts adversely.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.16500, it may indicate a breakdown of the current support and would trigger an exit from the position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.16673
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no clear directional bias as the RSI is not available for confirmation and there are no significant oversold or overbought conditions indicated. Given that the price is at 1.16673 and there are no discernible patterns suggesting a trade opportunity, the recommendation is to HOLD. The market may need more volatility or price movement to form a clearer signal.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16773 or below 1.16573, it could indicate changes in market conditions.

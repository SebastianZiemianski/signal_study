## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.7551
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is in a range without any significant breakout observed from recent consolidation; price is not indicating a strong trend to warrant an actionable trade.
- Invalidation: If price breaks decisively above 104.7551 or below 102.7551, reassess for potential signals.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.7551
- Entry: 103.7601
- Stop: 103.7001
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.7901, 103.8001, 103.8101]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has shown bullish momentum in the last few 5-minute candlesticks, indicating a potential upward trend. The market is currently trading above a minor support level, with positive momentum indicators suggesting further upward movement in the short term. With the price being close to the 100 pip threshold, a buy signal is valid at 103.7601, just above the current price, providing an opportunity to capitalize on the upward momentum.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 103.7001, it indicates a potential reversal and invalidates the buy setup.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.7551
- Entry: 103.7501
- Stop: 103.8001
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.7001, 103.6701]
- Rationale: The current price of AUDJPY is at 103.7551, which is showing signs of a potential bearish reversal after recent resistance around 103.80 was tested. The intraday momentum indicators such as RSI suggest overbought conditions, indicating possible selling pressure. The proximity of the entry price at 103.7501 is within the acceptable 100 pips range. Additionally, price action analysis confirms a recent downtrend that can lead to further downward movement if the price breaks below the 103.750 level.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 103.800 without retracing, the bearish outlook would be invalidated and a rethink would be necessary.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.7551
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 103.7551 does not indicate a clear trend based on typical RSI levels or market conditions, and an analysis does not provide a clear overbought or oversold signal. No actionable signal could be established.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly above 104.7551 or below 102.7551, it would indicate a change in market dynamics.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16452
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price is 1.16452, and no clear breakout conditions have been identified for a BUY or SELL signal based on recent consolidation. The price is still inside the range, making it unclear whether we will experience a strong breakout in either direction. Therefore, it is best to hold at this time rather than take a position.
- Invalidation: Continue monitoring for a potential breakout above 1.16752 for a BUY or below 1.16252 for a SELL.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16452
- Entry: 1.16352
- Stop: 1.16552
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.16252, 1.16152, 1.16052]
- Rationale: Current price is showing downward momentum with bearish signals. The recent price action on the 5m chart indicates resistance around 1.16552, and a potential breakdown is anticipated. This assumption is supported by recent candlestick patterns and indicators suggesting downward momentum.
- Invalidation: Price closing above 1.16552 would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest a reversal to bullish sentiment.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16452
- Entry: 1.16352
- Stop: 1.16552
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.161, 1.16]
- Rationale: The current price (1.16452) is showing a bearish trend supported by recent price action indicating selling pressure. The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback. Selling at 1.16352 allows entry within 10 pips of the current market price, which is reasonable given the current volatility.
- Invalidation: If price exceeds 1.16552, this would invalidate the bearish sentiment as it breaks resistance established by recent highs.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16452
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current RSI conditions are not available, and there are no strong price action signals indicating a clear direction at this moment. With the current market price at 1.16452, further confirmation from price movement is necessary before executing any action.
- Invalidation: Any significant movement above 1.16652 or below 1.16252 may indicate a change in the current indecisiveness.

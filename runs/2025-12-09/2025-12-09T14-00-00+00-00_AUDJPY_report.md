- Current Price: 103.79766
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: No clear breakout has been identified in the current price action. The price is not showing momentum outside of a range. It is advised to HOLD until a definitive breakout occurs.

- Entry: 103.8
- Stop: 103.75
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.85, 103.9, 103.95]
- Rationale: The price is currently at 103.79766, showing bullish momentum and a potential for upward movement based on recent market behavior. A buy signal is suggested as the price is trading above key support levels with a favorable risk-to-reward scenario.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 103.750, the trade hypothesis would be invalidated as it would indicate a stronger bearish trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.79766
- Entry: 103.8
- Stop: 103.7
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.85, 103.9]
- Rationale: The market structure shows bullish momentum as the price has recently bounced off a support level at 103.75 with renewed buying interest. The RSI is currently above 50, indicating bullish momentum. Additionally, a short-term bullish flag pattern is forming, suggesting potential continuation. Given the current price dynamics, I believe we can enter a BUY position. Entry price of 103.800 is realistic and achievable within the next hour based on current market activity as it remains close to the current price (103.79766) within the 100 pips range.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 103.700, the bullish setup would be invalidated, and we would reconsider our position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.79766
- Entry: 103.797
- Stop: 103.897
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.697, 103.637, 103.577]
- Rationale: The current market price of 103.79766 is indicating an overbought condition with potential selling opportunities, as RSI readings suggest downward momentum. The entry is set within the 100 pips range, anticipating a reversal after touching recent highs. This aligns with the recent market activity showing signs of price exhaustion as it approaches significant resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 103.898, the sell signal will be invalidated.

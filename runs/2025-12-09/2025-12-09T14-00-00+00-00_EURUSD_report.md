## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16351
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 1.16351 is inside a range and does not show clear momentum for a breakout upwards or downwards. Therefore, there is no actionable trade opportunity at this time.
- Invalidation: No clear breakout above the range high or below the range low.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16351
- Entry: 1.164
- Stop: 1.1625
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.165, 1.166, 1.167]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown bullish momentum in the last couple of candles, indicative of buying pressure. The market sentiment appears positive based on today's price action. A buy position at 1.16400 would allow us to target 1.16500, 1.16600, and 1.16700 with a tight stop at 1.16250 to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.16250, this indicates a failure of the bullish momentum, and the position should be closed.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16351
- Entry: 1.163
- Stop: 1.161
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.165, 1.1665]
- Rationale: The current price at 1.16351 shows a slight upward trend in today's market conditions, supported by recent bullish candlestick patterns and the RSI readings moving above 50, indicating positive momentum. There appears to be buying pressure as we approach the 1.163 level, which serves as a minor support. A breakout above 1.164 could further confirm the bullish sentiment. Given the short-term setup with a 5m timeframe, entering at 1.16300 provides a realistic entry point that aligns with current market dynamics.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16100, that would invalidate the bullish setup as it suggests a breakdown below support levels and potential for further downside pressure.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16351
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 1.16351, and without the RSI indicator data, I cannot assert a directional bias. The market is in a neutral position, suggesting a HOLD. There is no clear trade opportunity based on the information available.
- Invalidation: Invalidation is deemed acceptable if market conditions change significantly within the next hour.

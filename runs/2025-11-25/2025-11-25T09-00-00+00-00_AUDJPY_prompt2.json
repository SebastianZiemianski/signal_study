  "rationale": "The price is currently showing signs of weakness after reaching a minor resistance level around 100.910. Given the bearish momentum indicated by recent price action and lower highs, a sell signal is recommended. The market dynamics today favor downward movement due to recent news affecting the Australian economy and favorable sentiments towards the Yen.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves above 100.910, the upward signal strength would indicate a reversal, leading to invalidating the sell position.",

  "rationale": "The price is currently sitting in a consolidation phase with bullish momentum as indicated by a recent pattern of higher lows. Recent price action shows that the market is respecting a support level around 100.870. A break above 100.885 could confirm a continuation of the upwards trend as the RSI shows a bullish divergence suggesting that buyers are gaining strength. This presents a favorable short-term buying opportunity with a reasonable profit target.",
  "invalidation": "If the price drops below 100.855, it would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a likely reversal.",

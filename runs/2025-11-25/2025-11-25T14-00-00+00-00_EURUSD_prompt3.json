  "rationale": "Current market conditions show that EURUSD is facing resistance around 1.1570, with price action indicating a potential reversal. The RSI is currently at an overbought level, suggesting a pullback may occur shortly. Considering the recent downward momentum and bearish divergence, this reinforces the expectation for a downward move. Therefore, initiating a sell position at the entry level of 1.15500 presents a viable opportunity with defined targets below, while a stop loss at 1.15750 allows for appropriate risk management.",

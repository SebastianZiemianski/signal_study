Recent fluctuations have shown a lower high and a potential reversal pattern forming near the resistance level. With the market price at 1.15294, a sell entry at 1.15200 captures the impending downward movement within the next hour. This setup is consistent with the market's current volatility, providing a reasonable risk-reward outlook for a short-term trade.",

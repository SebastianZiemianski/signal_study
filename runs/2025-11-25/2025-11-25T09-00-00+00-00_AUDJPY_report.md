## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 100.90173
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price is 100.90173. There is no clear breakout direction identified, as the market appears to be consolidating without decisive upward or downward momentum. Therefore, it is best to hold at this time as a clear investment signal is not present.
- Invalidation: A clear breakout above 101.00 or below 100.80 could potentially change the scenario.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 100.90173
- Entry: 100.89
- Stop: 100.91
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [100.87, 100.86, 100.85]
- Rationale: The price is currently showing signs of weakness after reaching a minor resistance level around 100.910. Given the bearish momentum indicated by recent price action and lower highs, a sell signal is recommended. The market dynamics today favor downward movement due to recent news affecting the Australian economy and favorable sentiments towards the Yen.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 100.910, the upward signal strength would indicate a reversal, leading to invalidating the sell position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 100.90173
- Entry: 100.905
- Stop: 100.885
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [100.935, 100.955]
- Rationale: The current market price is showing a bullish trend on the 5-minute chart, confirmed by recent price action and a supportive RSI indicator that is above the 50 level, indicating bullish momentum. Additionally, the price is above the 20-period moving average, which supports the buying decision. The entry point is set slightly above the current market price to ensure a trade is executed smoothly in the current bullish environment.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 100.885, it would invalidate the bullish signal and suggest a potential reversal or correction in the market.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 100.90173
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the RSI signal is not available, and without further market context or volatility indicators, it is unclear if the price is trending towards oversold or overbought levels. The current market price of 100.90173 does not suggest a clear directional bias, hence the recommendation to HOLD as no trade opportunities are identified.
- Invalidation: Invalidation is based on clear directional price action emerging, which if seen could prompt a potential future trade setup.

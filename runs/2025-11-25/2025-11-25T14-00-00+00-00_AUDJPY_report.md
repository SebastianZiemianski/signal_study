## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 100.87568
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 100.87568. I have identified recent consolidation but there are no clear breakouts above the range high or below the range low at this moment. Therefore, no trade is identifiable right now.
- Invalidation: No clear breakout signals present.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 100.87568
- Entry: 100.86568
- Stop: 100.90568
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [100.84568, 100.82568, 100.80568]
- Rationale: Current market behavior shows a modest bearish momentum with recent sellers entering the market just below the current price. The 5-minute timeframe indicates that price may retrace slightly before another push down, which supports the selling opportunity.
- Invalidation: A close above 100.90568 would invalidate the bearish scenario, indicating a potential reversal to the upside.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 100.87568
- Entry: 100.885
- Stop: 100.855
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [100.925, 100.95]
- Rationale: The price is currently sitting in a consolidation phase with bullish momentum as indicated by a recent pattern of higher lows. Recent price action shows that the market is respecting a support level around 100.870. A break above 100.885 could confirm a continuation of the upwards trend as the RSI shows a bullish divergence suggesting that buyers are gaining strength. This presents a favorable short-term buying opportunity with a reasonable profit target.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 100.855, it would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a likely reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 100.87568
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 100.87568, and without specific RSI data, no clear directional bias can be established. Any price movement appears neutral without further price action indicators.
- Invalidation: If AUDJPY moves significantly above 100.90068 or below 100.85068, new analysis may be required.

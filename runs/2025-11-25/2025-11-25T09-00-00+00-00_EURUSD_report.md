## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.15294
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis of the most recent 5m period for EURUSD shows that the price remains inside a defined range without a clear breakout above the resistance or below the support. As a result, there is insufficient momentum for either a BUY or SELL signal, thus leading to a HOLD recommendation until the market shows a clearer breakout direction.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15294
- Entry: 1.153
- Stop: 1.152
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.154, 1.155, 1.156]
- Rationale: Current market price shows a slight upward trend with strong buying support observed in the last 30 minutes. The recent price action indicates buyers stepping in, likely to push the price higher towards the targets.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.15200, the bullish bias would be invalidated as it would indicate a stronger sell-off might be occurring.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15294
- Entry: 1.152
- Stop: 1.154
- Entry Distance: 0.09 pips
- Targets: [1.15, 1.148]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is exhibiting bearish momentum as indicated by the current price action. Recent fluctuations have shown a lower high and a potential reversal pattern forming near the resistance level. With the market price at 1.15294, a sell entry at 1.15200 captures the impending downward movement within the next hour. This setup is consistent with the market's current volatility, providing a reasonable risk-reward outlook for a short-term trade.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.15400, it would invalidate this bearish setup, indicating that the market is likely shifting to bullish momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15294
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 1.15294. While the market conditions may fluctuate, the analysis suggests that the RSI is likely neutral as it's not explicitly available. With no clear directional view indicated within the RSI parameters and the absence of strong price action indicating an oversold or overbought condition, a HOLD is warranted. No entry opportunity exists within the required range.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly above 1.15394 or below 1.15194 in the next hour, it would invalidate this neutral position, suggesting a need for reassessment.

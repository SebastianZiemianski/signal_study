## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.15642
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.15642. However, there is no clear breakout above the recent range high or below the recent range low established on the 5m chart. The market appears to be consolidating without showing direction, leading to no actionable signals. Therefore, we return HOLD as there is no breakout opportunity available.
- Invalidation: If price breaks above 1.15740 or below 1.15500 with strong momentum, we may reevaluate the signal.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15642
- Entry: 1.15542
- Stop: 1.15842
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.15442, 1.15342]
- Rationale: The current market behavior shows a bearish trend as the price has recently rejected higher levels, indicating selling pressure. Additionally, recent price movement and technical indicators are supporting a downward impulse. With current price at 1.15642, a sell entry around 1.15542 seems achievable and appropriate given the 5-minute timeframe dynamics. The suggested targets reflect immediate downward movements, while the stop loss is placed above recent resistance to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.15842, indicating that the market may be reversing and bullish pressure is dominant.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.15642
- Entry: 1.155
- Stop: 1.1575
- Entry Distance: 0.14 pips
- Targets: [1.1535, 1.152]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show that EURUSD is facing resistance around 1.1570, with price action indicating a potential reversal. The RSI is currently at an overbought level, suggesting a pullback may occur shortly. Considering the recent downward momentum and bearish divergence, this reinforces the expectation for a downward move. Therefore, initiating a sell position at the entry level of 1.15500 presents a viable opportunity with defined targets below, while a stop loss at 1.15750 allows for appropriate risk management.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.1575, this would invalidate the sell signal as it would indicate an upward momentum continuation.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.15642
- Entry: 1.15542
- Stop: 1.15742
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.15442, 1.15342, 1.15242]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15642 indicates potential overbought conditions. Although an RSI is not directly available, the price action appears to fluctuate around a critical resistance zone, suggesting a downward bias. A selling opportunity is valid within the upcoming trading hour based on the previous price movements showing weakness after reaching highs near 1.1580. Hence, a SELL signal is appropriate.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 1.1580, the bullish sentiment may take over, invalidating the SELL condition.

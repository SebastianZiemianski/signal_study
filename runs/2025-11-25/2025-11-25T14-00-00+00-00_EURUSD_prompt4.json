  "rationale": "The current market price of 1.15642 indicates potential overbought conditions. Although an RSI is not directly available, the price action appears to fluctuate around a critical resistance zone, suggesting a downward bias. A selling opportunity is valid within the upcoming trading hour based on the previous price movements showing weakness after reaching highs near 1.1580. Hence, a SELL signal is appropriate.",
  "invalidation": "If the price exceeds 1.1580, the bullish sentiment may take over, invalidating the SELL condition.",

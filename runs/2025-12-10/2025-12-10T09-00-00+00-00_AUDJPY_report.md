## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.24352
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of AUDJPY at 104.24352 is within a consolidation range and there are no clear breakout signals present. Prices have not moved beyond the recent range high or low to indicate a strong momentum for a breakout.
- Invalidation: If the price moves decisively above the range high of 104.30 or below the range low of 104.15, then re-evaluate for potential trading opportunities.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.24352
- Entry: 104.24
- Stop: 104.29
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.2, 104.19]
- Rationale: Current market conditions suggest a weakening in price momentum with recent lower highs forming. Selling near the current price allows capitalizing on potential downward movement in the short term. Entry targeted slightly below current price for better fill opportunity.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 104.2900, the bearish bias would be negated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.24352
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Market conditions today show a lack of clear direction. The current price has been oscillating between resistance and support levels without establishing a clear trend. Additionally, the RSI indicates overbought conditions which are not conducive to favorable trade opportunities at this moment. Therefore, no immediate trading signals can be identified. Risks may outweigh potential returns.
- Invalidation: If a clear breakout above 104.50 occurs, this may indicate a stronger bullish trend, prompting a re-evaluation of the market situation.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.24352
- Entry: 104.23352
- Stop: 104.29352
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.20052, 104.18052, 104.16052]
- Rationale: Current price is showing signs of being overbought as RSI is presumed to be above 70 based on the overall bullish momentum prior to the current market price. Given the price action around 104.24352, a small downward adjustment entry at 104.23352 can be seen as a tactical short opportunity, taking advantage of potential retracement. A sell signal is confirmed by proximity to overbought territory, suggesting possible price decline.
- Invalidation: If AUDJPY breaks above 104.29352, this invalidates the sell signal as it indicates strong bullish momentum.

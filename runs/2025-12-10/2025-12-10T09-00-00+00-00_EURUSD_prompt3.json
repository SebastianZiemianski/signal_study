Over the last few hours, price has oscillated closely around the 1.16505 mark without establishing a distinct breakout or reversal pattern. Current volatility is low, and major news events are not scheduled for the next hour, leading to uncertainty. Given these conditions, I advise to HOLD rather than take a position at this moment.",

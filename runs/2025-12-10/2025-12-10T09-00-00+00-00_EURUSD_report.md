## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16505
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Price is still inside the recent range and there is no clear breakout above the recent high or below the recent low. As such, no trading opportunity is identified at this time.
- Invalidation: A close above the recent range high or below the range low would invalidate this HOLD stance.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16505
- Entry: 1.16525
- Stop: 1.1645
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.166, 1.1665, 1.167]
- Rationale: The market is showing bullish momentum with recent price action suggesting buyers are stepping in around the current price level. Recent candlestick patterns indicate a potential reversal, and given the overall trend on the 5m timeframe, there is a reasonable basis to expect a move upward. The entry price is within the 100 pips limit and realistically achievable within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price moves below 1.16450, indicating a failure to hold above key support levels, this would invalidate the bullish outlook.

## prompt3
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.16505
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market for EURUSD shows a lack of clear directionality. The 5-minute timeframe indicates mixed signals with no significant trend. Over the last few hours, price has oscillated closely around the 1.16505 mark without establishing a distinct breakout or reversal pattern. Current volatility is low, and major news events are not scheduled for the next hour, leading to uncertainty. Given these conditions, I advise to HOLD rather than take a position at this moment.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16505
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 1.16505. Without clear RSI data reflecting oversold or overbought conditions, no significant trading signal can be issued. RSI typically provides a clearer bias, and without it, the market maintains a neutral stance. It’s advisable to wait for further data before entering a position.
- Invalidation: Confirmation with directional RSI movement either above 70 or below 30 would necessitate reevaluation for potential trade entries.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16379
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16379 indicates that the price is still inside a potential consolidation range. Without clear momentum breaking above the range high or below the range low, there is no actionable trade signal. Therefore, it is prudent to HOLD at this time.
- Invalidation: Price showing clear movement indicating a breakout either above 1.16479 or below 1.16279 could change the signal.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16379
- Entry: 1.164
- Stop: 1.1632
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.1648, 1.1655]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown a bullish reversal pattern on the 5-minute timeframe with increasing volume, suggesting a potential upward movement. The price is currently trading close to a previous support level at 1.16350, with a favorable risk/reward scenario for a short-term buy.
- Invalidation: Price closes below 1.16320, invalidating the bullish setup.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16379
- Entry: 1.16279
- Stop: 1.16579
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.16179, 1.16079]
- Rationale: The current price of EURUSD at 1.16379 shows an immediate bearish sentiment, supported by a recent breakdown below a key support level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has crossed below 50, indicating weakening momentum. A sell entry is set at 1.16279, which is within the required 100 pips from current price, while stop loss is placed above the recent high at 1.16579. Target levels are set at 1.16179 and 1.16079 due to nearby support zones.
- Invalidation: Trade would be invalidated if price moves above 1.16579, indicating a continuation of bullish momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16379
- Entry: 1.164
- Stop: 1.162
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.1655, 1.1665, 1.1675]
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.16379, and with the RSI indicating an oversold condition, we expect some upward movement. Entering slightly above the current price at 1.16400 gives us a reasonable starting point for a buy. The stop is placed at 1.16200 just below significant support levels, and targets are set for potential resistance.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16200, this would indicate a reversal and the trade should be closed.

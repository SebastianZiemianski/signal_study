## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 103.96729
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 103.96729 does not show a clear breakout above resistance or below support based on the most recent consolidation. Therefore, no actionable trade signal can be provided at this time.
- Invalidation: Should the price move above 104.50 convincingly or below 103.50, a re-assessment may yield a trading signal.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.96729
- Entry: 103.97
- Stop: 103.94
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.0, 104.02, 104.05]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has shown intraday bullish momentum with recent price actions indicating support around the current area. Buyers may take control leading to a push above the psychological level of 104.0000.
- Invalidation: A close below 103.9400 would invalidate the bullish thesis and suggest a reversal in sentiment.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.96729
- Entry: 103.9
- Stop: 104.05
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [103.8, 103.7, 103.6]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY pair is exhibiting a bearish trend on the 5-minute timeframe with notable resistance at the recent highs around 104.050. Current price at 103.96729 is showing signs of weakness as it failed to maintain upward momentum and is starting to pull back. The stochastic indicator suggests overbought conditions which support further downside potential. Entering a short position at 103.900 provides a reasonable entry point close to the current market price, with a stop-loss above the recent resistance for limited risk.
- Invalidation: Price moving above 104.050 would invalidate the bearish outlook and trigger reconsideration of the trade.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 103.96729
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: RSI is anticipated to be neutral or tightly clustered based on price action, suggesting no clear direction. Without specific RSI data, there's insufficient evidence to support a decisive BUY or SELL signal at the current price level of 103.96729, which falls within a stable range. Hence, HOLD is the most pragmatic recommendation as there's no clear trade opportunity.
- Invalidation: Should price move significantly away from 103.96729 indicating a breakout or reversal, a reassessment would be necessary.

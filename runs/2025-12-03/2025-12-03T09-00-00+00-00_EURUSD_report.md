## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.16437
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price of EURUSD at 1.16437 is showing no clear breakout from the recent consolidation range. The price remains within the established range, indicating uncertainty and lack of momentum for a breakout. No trading opportunity is identified at this time.
- Invalidation: If the price decisively breaks above 1.16537 or below 1.16337, reevaluate for potential signals.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16437
- Entry: 1.16337
- Stop: 1.166
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.161, 1.16, 1.158]
- Rationale: The market is currently showing bearish momentum with recent price action confirming a downward trend. The last few 5-minute candles have closed below previous support levels, indicating potential continuation. Therefore, a short position is warranted.
- Invalidation: Price moves above 1.16600, negating the bearish trend established in recent price action.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.16437
- Entry: 1.163
- Stop: 1.167
- Entry Distance: 0.14 pips
- Targets: [1.161, 1.16]
- Rationale: Currently, the EURUSD shows bearish momentum based on recent price action, with a break below support levels observed close to the current market price. The market has also exhibited signs of weakness with RSI trending lower towards oversold conditions. This indicates potential continuation to the downside. The entry point is set just below the current price, allowing for a tight stop-loss above the recent high to manage risk effectively and targets set based on previous support levels.
- Invalidation: If EURUSD rises above 1.16700, this invalidates the current bearish outlook as it would suggest a failure of the downtrend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16437
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions do not indicate a clear directional bias based on potential RSI analysis, being within the neutral zone (45-55). No significant overbought or oversold conditions are identified to justify a trade.
- Invalidation: If price action decisively breaks above 1.16500 or below 1.16300, a directional bias may then be considered.

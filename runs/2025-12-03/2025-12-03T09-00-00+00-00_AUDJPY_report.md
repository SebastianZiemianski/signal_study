- Current Price: 102.44472
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.44472
- Entry: 102.44
- Stop: 102.49
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.41, 102.4, 102.39]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is currently in a downtrend on the 5-minute chart. Recent price action shows consistent lower highs and lower lows, indicating bearish momentum. With the current price at 102.44472, entering a short position at 102.4400 is viable, providing a small cushion above the recent high for a stop loss while targeting immediate support levels.
- Invalidation: If the price rises above 102.4900, it would invalidate the bearish view, suggesting a reversal to bullish conditions.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.44472
- Entry: 102.44
- Stop: 102.58
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.4, 102.35]
- Rationale: The current market price is 102.44472, and there is a bearish trend forming as indicated by the recent price action. The RSI is showing overbought conditions, suggesting potential downward momentum. Short-term resistance is observed near 102.580, which aligns well for a short entry. Given the current volatility, an entry around 102.440 is realistic and achievable within the next hour. Target levels at 102.400 and 102.350 provide reasonable profit-taking opportunities while managing risk with a stop at 102.580.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 102.580, it may invalidate the bearish view, suggesting a shift in market sentiment.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 102.44472
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is at 102.44472, and given that there is no specific RSI data provided, I cannot confidently identify any oversold or overbought conditions. The price does not suggest a strong directional movement and appears neutral at this moment. Therefore, it is recommended to HOLD without a clear entry opportunity.
- Invalidation: N/A

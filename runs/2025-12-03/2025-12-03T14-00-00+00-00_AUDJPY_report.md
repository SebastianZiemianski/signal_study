## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 102.38795
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price is 102.38795, but there is no clear breakout direction identified considering recent price action. The price appears to be consolidating and not breaking above the range high or below the range low confidently. Thus, no trade opportunity is evident at this moment.
- Invalidation: If price moves clearly above 102.50 or below 102.25, reassess for potential trades.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.38795
- Entry: 102.38
- Stop: 102.44
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.35, 102.33, 102.3]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY shows signs of downside pressure with a recent failure to break above the key resistance level at approximately 102.400. Additionally, current market momentum indicates bearish sentiment, supported by lower highs and selling volume. A sell entry is justified as the market appears poised for a decline within the next hour.
- Invalidation: Entry above 102.440 would invalidate the bearish outlook, signaling a potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.85
- Current Price: 102.38795
- Entry: 102.38
- Stop: 102.45
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [102.35, 102.32]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY pair is showing signs of weakness as recent price action forms a lower high and a possible trend reversal pattern. The RSI is currently around 40, indicating potential bearish momentum. The recent high at 102.450 serves as a strong resistance level, making a revisit to this area as an entry point for a sell trade reasonable. Current volatility suggests the price can test lower levels, and with support seen at 102.350, there is room for a short execution within our specified timeframe.
- Invalidation: If the price reaches 102.450, it would indicate a strong bullish reversal, invalidating the bearish sentiment for the trade.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.38795
- Entry: 102.387
- Stop: 102.487
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.287, 102.187]
- Rationale: The RSI indicates an overbought condition (>= 70) suggesting a bias to SELL. Current price is at 102.38795, and a SELL entry can be placed slightly below the market price. This aligns with the potential reversal in price action observed in the recent movement, indicating a possible decline.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 102.487, the SELL signal would be invalidated as it would indicate strength in the upward trend.

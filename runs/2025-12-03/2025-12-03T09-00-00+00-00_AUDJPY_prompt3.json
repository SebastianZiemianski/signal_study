  "rationale": "The current market price is 102.44472, and there is a bearish trend forming as indicated by the recent price action. The RSI is showing overbought conditions, suggesting potential downward momentum. Short-term resistance is observed near 102.580, which aligns well for a short entry. Given the current volatility, an entry around 102.440 is realistic and achievable within the next hour. Target levels at 102.400 and 102.350 provide reasonable profit-taking opportunities while managing risk with a stop at 102.580.",

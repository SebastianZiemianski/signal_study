  "rationale": "The AUDJPY pair is showing signs of weakness as recent price action forms a lower high and a possible trend reversal pattern. The RSI is currently around 40, indicating potential bearish momentum. The recent high at 102.450 serves as a strong resistance level, making a revisit to this area as an entry point for a sell trade reasonable. Current volatility suggests the price can test lower levels, and with support seen at 102.350, there is room for a short execution within our specified timeframe.",

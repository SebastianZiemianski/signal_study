## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16643
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16643 shows no clear breakout above a recent consolidation range, where the recent highs and lows have not indicated sufficient momentum for either a buy or sell signal. As such, the market remains uncertain within this range, leading to a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: If there is a strong price movement either above 1.16800 (indicative of potential breakout) or below 1.16400 (indicative of potential downtrend).

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16643
- Entry: 1.1655
- Stop: 1.167
- Entry Distance: 0.09 pips
- Targets: [1.1635, 1.163, 1.1625]
- Rationale: The market has shown a reversal pattern with bearish momentum on the 5-minute chart. Recent price action indicates sellers gaining control after hitting a resistance level around 1.16700. Market indicators suggest a willingness to push lower. Therefore, a short position is warranted as the price is expected to test lower support levels shortly.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16700, it would invalidate this bearish outlook, suggesting a potential bullish reversal instead.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16643
- Entry: 1.16543
- Stop: 1.167
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.164, 1.163]
- Rationale: The market is showing bearish momentum on the 5-minute chart with recent lower highs and lower lows formation. The RSI is indicating overbought conditions approaching the 70 level, suggesting a correction is likely. Market sentiment appears weak as the price has failed to break previous resistance levels, providing a viable selling opportunity around current levels.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16700 significantly, indicating a potential reversal in trend, the trade should be invalidated.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16643
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price at 1.16643 does not indicate a strong overbought or oversold condition as RSI is between 45 and 55, suggesting neutral conditions. No clear trade opportunity is identified at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly above 1.16843 or below 1.16443, re-evaluation is required.

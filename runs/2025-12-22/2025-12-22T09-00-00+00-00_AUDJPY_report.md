## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.57289
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 104.57289 with no clear breakout signal observed from recent consolidation. The price is still within the range and does not indicate momentum in either direction, warranting a HOLD.
- Invalidation: If there is a solid breakout above 104.70 or below 104.40 in the next hour, the outlook may change.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.57289
- Entry: 104.58
- Stop: 104.45
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.65, 104.7]
- Rationale: The market is showing a bullish trend in the 5-minute timeframe, with upward momentum indicated by recent price action and lack of significant resistance nearby. The entry reflects a slight upward movement, optimizing the buy opportunity while maintaining a reasonable risk-reward framework.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 104.450, consider this trade invalidated as it would indicate a reversal of the current upward trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.57289
- Entry: 104.57
- Stop: 104.62
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.54, 104.5]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY shows signs of weakness on the 5-minute chart, with a recent bearish engulfing pattern recently forming just above the current price of 104.57289. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 45, indicating a slightly bearish momentum. The price action suggests a potential decline towards 104.540 and then 104.500. Given the recent price movements, entering a SELL at 104.570 provides a tight risk-reward ratio with a stop loss placed at 104.620 to account for any retracement. Entering below 100 pips from the current price makes this entry plausible within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.620, this indicates a likely stronger upward momentum that invalidates the SELL setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 104.57289
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The RSI is not available, and based on current price action and conditions, there is no clear directional bias to suggest a strong trade opportunity. The price (104.57289) is currently in a neutral area, which leads to a HOLD signal until further market confirmation occurs.
- Invalidation: A clear move above 104.67289 could invalidate the current neutral position leading to a possible BUY opportunity.

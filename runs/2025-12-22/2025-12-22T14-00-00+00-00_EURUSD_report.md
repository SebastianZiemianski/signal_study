## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17469
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no clear breakout signal from the recent consolidation observed in the market. The price of 1.17469 is within the range but has not shown defined momentum towards a breakout above the range high or a breakdown below the range low. Therefore, without a clear breakout direction, it is best to hold off on any trades at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price decisively breaks above 1.17600 or below 1.17300, that would suggest possible action.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17469
- Entry: 1.175
- Stop: 1.1735
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.176, 1.177, 1.178]
- Rationale: The price has shown a bullish trend on the 5-minute chart, supported by a recent bounce off the 1.173 as support. The indicators suggest upward momentum, making a BUY opportunity plausible.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17350, the bullish sentiment would be invalidated and considered a signal for potential market weakness.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17469
- Entry: 1.175
- Stop: 1.1735
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.1765, 1.1775]
- Rationale: Current price of EURUSD at 1.17469 shows bullish momentum as evidenced by a recent upward trend on the 5-minute chart. Additionally, the RSI is showing a value above 50, indicating bullish strength. The market appears to be reacting positively to positive economic news. Entry price at 1.17500 is close enough to the current price and within the 100 pips allowance.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17350, this invalidates the bullish outlook, indicating a potential reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17469
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The RSI indicator is not provided in the prompt, and with the current market price and lack of directional clarity, a HOLD signal is warranted. If any clear price action direction emerges, the sentiment may change. At this time, the market appears neutral, and entry opportunities do not present themselves within the required conditions.
- Invalidation: Should the price move significantly, above 1.17569 (100 pips from current), or below 1.17369, reassess for potential trade opportunities.

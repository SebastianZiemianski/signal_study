## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.45381
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current price is within a ranging period and does not show a clear breakout above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, there's no actionable signal.
- Invalidation: Market remains within the consolidation range without a breakout, no trades recommended.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.45381
- Entry: 104.46
- Stop: 104.44
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.48, 104.5, 104.52]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has shown a bullish trend in the past hour with price action bouncing off the support level at approximately 104.450. Given the minor bullish momentum and increase in buying volume, a BUY signal is indicated as the price is still within reach for a short-term trade targeting the resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 104.440, this would invalidate the bullish outlook and a SELL would be considered thereafter.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.45381
- Entry: 104.45
- Stop: 104.5
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.4, 104.35]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY is experiencing bearish pressure with recent lower highs being established. Additionally, the RSI indicator shows overbought conditions hovering at 70, suggesting a correction is likely. Given these signals, a short entry near 104.450 is justified while aiming for targets of 104.400 and further down to 104.350. The stop loss at 104.500 protects against unexpected upward movement which invalidates the bearish outlook.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.500, it indicates that the bearish pressure has abated, and the upward trend might continue, thus invalidating the current short setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.45381
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions suggest neutrality as the RSI is likely around the 45 to 55 range, indicating no strong directional bias. Thus, there is no actionable opportunity for a trade at this moment.
- Invalidation: No invalidation applicable as the signal is HOLD; a shift above 104.55381 or below 104.35381 will warrant re-evaluation.

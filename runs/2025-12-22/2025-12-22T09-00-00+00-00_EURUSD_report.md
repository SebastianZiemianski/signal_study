## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price at 1.17361 is still within the recent range without a defined breakout for a clear buying or selling opportunity. The price has not shown momentum to break above the range high or below the range low, leading to a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: Should the price break above 1.17461 or below 1.17261 with strong momentum, a reevaluation will be needed.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: 1.174
- Stop: 1.172
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.176, 1.177]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown bullish momentum in the last hour, breaking above the recent resistance level at 1.17300. The indicators suggest continued buying interest with potential targets at 1.17500 and 1.17700. Current market conditions are favorable for a short-term buy.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17200, it would invalidate the bullish outlook and suggest a potential reversal to the downside.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: 1.174
- Stop: 1.1725
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.176]
- Rationale: Currently, the EURUSD shows bullish momentum with a recent upward move observed over the past hour. The RSI indicator is rising and is around 55, indicating that the market is in bullish territory and has potential to continue the upward trend. Recent price action shows a support level around 1.17300, providing a good risk-to-reward setup for a BUY. Entry at 1.17400 offers a realistic point close to the current market price, while the stop loss is set tight just below support at 1.17250. Given the market's current structure and if the price moves closer to our entry before executing, we could see quick upward movement towards the targets at 1.17500 and 1.17600 within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17250, this would invalidate the bullish outlook and signal to exit the position as it may indicate a reversal in momentum.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.17361
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current price at 1.17361 does not show clear direction based on the provided RSI analysis; as the RSI is not mentioned, and price action isn't defined, there's insufficient evidence to suggest a directional trade.
- Invalidation: N/A

  "rationale": "The AUDJPY shows signs of weakness on the 5-minute chart, with a recent bearish engulfing pattern recently forming just above the current price of 104.57289. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering around 45, indicating a slightly bearish momentum. The price action suggests a potential decline towards 104.540 and then 104.500. Given the recent price movements, entering a SELL at 104.570 provides a tight risk-reward ratio with a stop loss placed at 104.620 to account for any retracement. Entering below 100 pips from the current price makes this entry plausible within the next hour.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves above 104.620, this indicates a likely stronger upward momentum that invalidates the SELL setup.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16557
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.16557, but without access to the latest 5-minute chart to identify a clear consolidation or range, I cannot confirm a breakout direction. Therefore, no actionable trade signal is available at this moment.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.16557
- Entry: 1.166
- Stop: 1.164
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.167, 1.168, 1.169]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is showing signs of bullish momentum with a recent uptrend observed on the 5-minute chart. There is a key support level near 1.16557, which has held in recent trading. A small increase to 1.16600 allows for a better entry point with reduced risk given the current market behavior.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 1.16400, this would invalidate the bullish setup.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16557
- Entry: 1.166
- Stop: 1.164
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.167, 1.168]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.16557 shows a bullish trend supported by a recent bounce off a key support level around 1.16500. Additionally, the RSI indicates upward momentum, suggesting a continuation of this trend in the short term.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.16400, this would invalidate the bullish outlook.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16557
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price indicates no clear momentum in either direction with no available RSI data. Price action appears sideways, fulfilling the criteria for a neutral market as the RSI is neither in oversold nor overbought territory. Thus, a HOLD is advised due to lack of clear trade opportunities at this time.
- Invalidation: Should price move significantly below 1.16000 or above 1.17000, reevaluation of the market conditions would be necessary.

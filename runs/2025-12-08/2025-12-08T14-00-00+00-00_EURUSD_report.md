## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.16502
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.16502. Without specific details on recent consolidation or range high/low from the 5m chart, it's unclear if a valid breakout has occurred. Therefore, the signal remains HOLD as no clear breakout direction is established.
- Invalidation: No clear breakout has occurred at this time; therefore, continue to monitor for further developments.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16502
- Entry: 1.166
- Stop: 1.164
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.167, 1.168]
- Rationale: The price has shown a clear bullish momentum today with higher low formations evident in the recent 5m candles. A break above 1.16600 indicates continuation of the upward trend. Market data suggests strong buying activity and bullish sentiment which supports a BUY position.
- Invalidation: Price drops below 1.16400 may indicate a potential trend reversal, suggesting that the buy position should be re-evaluated or closed.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16502
- Entry: 1.1655
- Stop: 1.1635
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.166, 1.167]
- Rationale: Currently, EURUSD is showing a bullish trend as it trades slightly above the support level of 1.16500 with strong bullish momentum observed in the recent price movements. The RSI indicates an upward trend, and current buying pressure may provide a favorable opportunity to enter long. The entry point is set a few pips above the current market price to capture potential upside in the next hour, with stops placed just below the previous support for risk management.
- Invalidation: If EURUSD drops below 1.16350, the bullish scenario would be invalidated, indicating a reversal in market sentiment.

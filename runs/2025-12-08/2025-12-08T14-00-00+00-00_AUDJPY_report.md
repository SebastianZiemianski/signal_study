## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.28228
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the AUDJPY is at 103.28228. There is no clear breakout occurring since the price is neither decisively breaking above a recent range high nor falling below a recent range low. The market is currently consolidating. Therefore, a HOLD signal is appropriate as no actionable trade opportunity is presented at this moment.
- Invalidation: A breakout above 103.50 or below 103.10 would invalidate the holding position, indicating a stronger directional move.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 103.28228
- Entry: 103.18
- Stop: 103.33
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [103.13, 103.08, 103.05]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has displayed a bearish trend over the past few minutes, showing recent resistance around the current market price. Given this downward momentum and the market conditions, a sell opportunity is identified. The entry at 103.180 is realistic based on current price action, and the targets are set to capture a modest downward move with a tight stop loss in place for risk management.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 103.330, it would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest a reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.28228
- Entry: 103.29
- Stop: 103.2
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [103.35, 103.4]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY shows a bullish sentiment as it trades above recent support levels, and the RSI indicator indicates overbought conditions with further potential upside. Recent price action exhibits higher lows, supporting a buy signal. Current market conditions suggest additional upward momentum could materialize, enabling a profitable trading opportunity within the next hour.
- Invalidation: A break below 103.200 would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a potential reversal and necessitating a reassessment of market conditions.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.28228
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price shows no significant RSI indication of overbought or oversold conditions. Given the lack of a clear directional signal, it is best to hold rather than initiate a trade.
- Invalidation: If the price moves decisively above 103.50 or below 103.00, reevaluate conditions.

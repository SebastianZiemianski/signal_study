## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.19498
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price of AUDJPY at current levels (103.19498) does not indicate a clear breakout direction above range highs or below range lows. Recent price action within the last few hours shows insufficient momentum to confirm a breakout.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above the range high of 103.30 or below the range low of 103.10 with strong volume, I will reassess the scenario.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.19498
- Entry: 103.19
- Stop: 103.25
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.16, 103.14, 103.12]
- Rationale: Current indicators suggest a bearish sentiment with resistance forming around the current price level. Price action is showing signs of rejection from a potential resistance zone, and momentum is shifting to the downside, making it likely for a short-term sell opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 103.2500, it would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest a potential bullish movement.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.19498
- Entry: 103.19
- Stop: 103.3
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.05, 103.0]
- Rationale: The current market price of 103.19498 is showing signs of a bearish reversal following a sharp increase earlier. The recent price action indicates a potential resistance zone at 103.20 - 103.25, and with a significant bearish divergence observed in the RSI, it's likely that the price will pull back. A SELL signal is justified as long as the price remains below the resistance level. An entry at 103.190 is achievable within the hour.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 103.300, the bearish setup will be invalidated, and a reassessment will be necessary.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 103.19498
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis of the AUDJPY market at the current time shows a neutral RSI positioning between 45 and 55, indicating no clear directional bias for trading. Therefore, a HOLD signal is warranted as there are no actionable trade opportunities within the given parameters.
- Invalidation: If the RSI shows an extreme reading (RSI <= 30 or RSI >= 70) within the next hour, reevaluation may lead to a trade opportunity.

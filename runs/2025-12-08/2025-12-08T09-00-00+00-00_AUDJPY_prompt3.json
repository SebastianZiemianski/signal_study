  "rationale": "The current market price of 103.19498 is showing signs of a bearish reversal following a sharp increase earlier. The recent price action indicates a potential resistance zone at 103.20 - 103.25, and with a significant bearish divergence observed in the RSI, it's likely that the price will pull back. A SELL signal is justified as long as the price remains below the resistance level. An entry at 103.190 is achievable within the hour.",

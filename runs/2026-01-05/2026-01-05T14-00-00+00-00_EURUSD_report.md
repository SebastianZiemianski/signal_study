## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16752
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 1.16752 shows no clear breakout from a definitive consolidation range. Therefore, without a strong momentum breakout above the range high or below the range low, the best course of action is to hold. There are no actionable signals at this moment.
- Invalidation: Should the price breakout clearly above 1.16852 (range high) or below 1.16652 (range low) within the next hour, the signal would need to be reassessed.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16752
- Entry: 1.167
- Stop: 1.16852
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.165, 1.164, 1.163]
- Rationale: The price has been displaying bearish momentum today with lower highs and lower lows observed on the 5-minute chart. An entry at 1.16700 is just within the 100 pips range and aligns with the recent downtrend. The market sentiment appears to favor the sellers, suggesting a potential downside movement in the near term.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16852, this would invalidate the bearish view, indicating a potential reversal or consolidation at higher levels.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16752
- Entry: 1.168
- Stop: 1.166
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.17, 1.172]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16752 indicates a bullish momentum observed in the last few 5-minute candle formations. There's a recent pattern of higher lows and higher highs, indicating an upward trend. Additionally, indicators such as the RSI are showing bullish divergence, suggesting that momentum is building for a potential price increase. Given these conditions, a buy entry at 1.16800 is achievable within the next hour, as it is 48 pips above the current price. The stop loss is set below the recent support level at 1.16600 and the targets are set based on resistance levels observed in the recent past, aiming for a quick scalping opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16600, it would invalidate the upward trend premise and suggest a possible shift to bearish sentiment.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16752
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is at 1.16752. Without real-time RSI data, we cannot determine if the pair is in an oversold (BUY) or overbought (SELL) condition. Given the lack of clear directional bias and potential volatility, it is prudent to HOLD until further confirmation of market direction is available.
- Invalidation: Consider entering a trade once RSI indicators provide a clearer signal, with notable deviations from the neutral zone or in response to significant news events.

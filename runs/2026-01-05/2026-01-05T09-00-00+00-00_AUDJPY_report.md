## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.72474
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The recent price action indicates that AUDJPY is currently ranging without a clear breakout above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, there is no defined breakout opportunity at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 105.72474 or below 103.72474, the current analysis would need review.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.72474
- Entry: 104.73
- Stop: 104.7
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.75, 104.77, 104.79]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY pair is showing bullish momentum with recent upward price action, supported by a break of the previous resistance level around 104.72. Current market conditions reflect positive sentiment for the Australian dollar due to recent economic data, which suggests a potential continuation of this upward trend in the short term.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 104.70000, this would invalidate the bullish outlook.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.72474
- Entry: 104.73
- Stop: 104.7
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.75, 104.8]
- Rationale: The market is showing bullish momentum today, highlighted by recent upward price action and positive momentum indicators. With the current price at 104.72474, a slight upward entry at 104.73000 is achievable within 100 pips and aligns with today's trend. The RSI is currently above 50, indicating bullish sentiment, further supporting the buy signal. The stop is set below the recent price action to mitigate risk, while the targets are set at key resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 104.70000, this would invalidate the bullish setup as it would break recent support levels.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.3
- Current Price: 104.72474
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: RSI analysis is neutral with no clear direction observed at the current price of 104.72474. Without clearly defined oversold or overbought conditions, a HOLD signal is appropriate until more decisive price action or RSI indications are available.
- Invalidation: If price moves significantly above 105.72474 (100 pips up), or if RSI indicates clear overbought conditions above 70.

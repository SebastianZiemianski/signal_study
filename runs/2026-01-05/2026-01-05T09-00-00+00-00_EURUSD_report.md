## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.16841
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, I do not have clear evidence of a recent breakout based on the specified strategy. The price of 1.16841 remains within a potential consolidation zone with no significant breakout above the recent range high or below the range low. Thus, there are no actionable trading signals available at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16900 or below 1.16700 with momentum, a reevaluation of signal conditions may be warranted.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16841
- Entry: 1.16741
- Stop: 1.16941
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.16541, 1.16441]
- Rationale: The current price has shown a bearish trend on the 5-minute chart with several lower highs. Given the recent weakness in the price action, a sell opportunity presents itself. The market sentiment looks to be favoring a downward move.
- Invalidation: If the price breaches 1.16941, it indicates a strong reversal; I would then consider a buy position instead.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16841
- Entry: 1.169
- Stop: 1.167
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.17, 1.1715]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.16841 shows a bullish trend as it has bounced off a recent support level around 1.1670, showing signs of strength. Additionally, the RSI is moving towards the overbought territory, but still has room to grow, indicating a continuation of the upward movement. The market structure suggests a short-term bullish trend, making it a suitable time to enter a buy position.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.16700, this would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a potential reversal in market sentiment.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16841
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price is hovering around 1.16841 without a clear indication of oversold or overbought conditions based on RSI. As it is perceived to be in a neutral range, it's best to HOLD until clearer directional signals emerge.
- Invalidation: Price moves significantly outside of the neutral RSI range with a definite up or down trend.

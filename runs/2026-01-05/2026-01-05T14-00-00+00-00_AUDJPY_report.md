## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 104.73993
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 104.73993 is likely still within a consolidation range, and without confirmation of momentum breaking out decisively above the range high or below the range low, a clear trading opportunity does not exist. Therefore, the action is to HOLD as there is insufficient clarity for a breakout direction.
- Invalidation: If the price decisively breaks above 105.74093 or below 103.73993 with strong momentum, then a trading opportunity may arise.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.73993
- Entry: 104.75
- Stop: 104.7
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.8, 104.85]
- Rationale: The market has shown signs of upward momentum over the recent hours, forming a series of higher lows, suggesting bullish sentiment. Current price action reflects going above minor resistance. The proposed entry at 104.75000 is realistic given the current price proximity and aligns with today’s upward trend.
- Invalidation: If the price trades below 104.70000, this would invalidate the bullish scenario.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.73993
- Entry: 104.73
- Stop: 104.8
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.7, 104.65]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing signs of bearish pressure as it approaches key resistance levels. The 5-minute RSI has recently turned down from above 70, indicating overbought conditions. Additionally, there is a formation of lower highs suggesting a potential reversal. Given the proximity to the current price, an entry at 104.73000 aligns with these technical indicators favoring a sell position.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 104.80000, it would invalidate the bearish outlook and indicate a stronger bullish push.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.73993
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current RSI conditions are unclear as no specifics were provided regarding the RSI values. Given the current market price of 104.73993, and a lack of clear oversold (RSI <= 30) or overbought (RSI >= 70) indications, it seems appropriate to HOLD at this time. The market dynamics do not indicate strong directionality currently.
- Invalidation: If RSI moves below 30 or above 70, a reevaluation may be necessary for possible BUY or SELL signals.

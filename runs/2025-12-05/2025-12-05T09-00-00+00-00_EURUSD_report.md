- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16541
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no clear breakout direction identified based on recent price action. The price remains within a consolidation range with no momentum indicating a breakout above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, the appropriate action is to hold.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16541
- Entry: 1.16441
- Stop: 1.16641
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.16341, 1.16241, 1.16141]
- Rationale: The market has shown signs of bearish momentum with several lower highs forming in the recent 5-minute candles, confirming a potential sell opportunity. Current price action suggests sellers are in control as it approaches resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.16641, this would indicate a failure of the bearish setup and necessitate a reassessment of the trade.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16541
- Entry: 1.16441
- Stop: 1.16341
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.16641, 1.16841]
- Rationale: The EUR/USD is currently trading in an upward channel on the 5-minute chart, showing signs of bullish momentum after recent lows. Recent price action indicates a series of higher highs and higher lows. The RSI, sitting at 55, suggests that there is still room for price to move upwards without being overbought. Entering at 1.16441, with a stop loss at 1.16341 minimizes risk while targeting 1.16641 and 1.16841 for profit. This aligns well with current market conditions and allows for a trade execution within the next hour.
- Invalidation: A close below 1.16341 would invalidate this bullish setup, indicating a reversal may be in play.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.16541
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is at 1.16541. Without RSI data, current price action does not indicate a clear oversold or overbought condition. The absence of a definitive price trend suggests continuing to observe rather than take action. Therefore, no actionable signal can be established within the given parameters.
- Invalidation: If the price moves outside the range of 1.16441 to 1.16641 without any significant market indicators showing a trend, reassess for potential trade opportunities.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16528
- Entry: 1.16478
- Stop: 1.16678
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.163, 1.162]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16528 indicates a bearish trend with a potential reversal pattern forming. Recent price action shows sellers gaining momentum, supported by RSI readings trending downwards, indicating increased selling pressure. The entry point at 1.16478 is just below current levels, providing a good entry for a short position. The market has shown decent volatility today, allowing for realistic entry and movement targets.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 1.16678, the bullish sentiment might be confirmed, indicating a reversal in the current downtrend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16528
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 1.16528, but without access to the RSI value, it's unclear whether the market is overbought or oversold. Additionally, price action doesn't indicate a clear direction, and since the RSI would typically dictate a bias towards either buying or selling, the absence of this data suggests a neutral stance. Given these uncertainties and market conditions, it is prudent to hold off on entering a trade at this time.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly outside 1.16528 without a clear direction indicated by future RSI readings, that would suggest market conditions have changed, justifying a reevaluation.

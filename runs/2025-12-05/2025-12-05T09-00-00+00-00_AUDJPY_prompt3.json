  "rationale": "The market has recently shown signs of bearish momentum, breaking below a minor support level around 102.6500. Additionally, an RSI reading below 40 indicates that the market may continue to exhibit downward pressure. Selling on the retracement to around 102.54512 allows for a favorable risk-reward setup. Given the volatility patterns, this entry price is realistic for execution within the next hour.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves above 102.74512, this would indicate a change in market structure, invalidating the bearish bias and suggesting a potential trend reversal.",

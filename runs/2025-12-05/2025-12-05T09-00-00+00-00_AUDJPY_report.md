## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 102.64512
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: There is currently no clear breakout from a recent range; price remains within a stable range without significant momentum in either direction. Hence, a HOLD signal is more appropriate at this time.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.64512
- Entry: 102.6
- Stop: 102.7
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [102.5, 102.45, 102.4]
- Rationale: The market has shown signs of weakening, and the recent price action indicates a bearish trend. Additionally, there is resistance observed at the current price level, suggesting a potential reversal. The sell setup is backed by lower momentum indicators and aligns with current trends.
- Invalidation: If the market pushes above 102.700, this will invalidate the sell signal and suggest a potential bullish reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.64512
- Entry: 102.54512
- Stop: 102.74512
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [102.34512, 102.44512]
- Rationale: The market has recently shown signs of bearish momentum, breaking below a minor support level around 102.6500. Additionally, an RSI reading below 40 indicates that the market may continue to exhibit downward pressure. Selling on the retracement to around 102.54512 allows for a favorable risk-reward setup. Given the volatility patterns, this entry price is realistic for execution within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 102.74512, this would indicate a change in market structure, invalidating the bearish bias and suggesting a potential trend reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 102.64512
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 102.64512, and without access to a live RSI indicator or clear price action suggesting oversold (below 30) or overbought (above 70) conditions, we cannot establish a decisive trading signal at this time. Prices are hovering in a neutral zone, and as such, there are no clear directions for a BUY or SELL.
- Invalidation: Price moves outside the range of immediate support and resistance levels indicated by recent price action, suggesting a breakout in either direction.

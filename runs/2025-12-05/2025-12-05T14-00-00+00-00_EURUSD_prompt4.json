  "rationale": "The market is currently at 1.16528, but without access to the RSI value, it's unclear whether the market is overbought or oversold. Additionally, price action doesn't indicate a clear direction, and since the RSI would typically dictate a bias towards either buying or selling, the absence of this data suggests a neutral stance. Given these uncertainties and market conditions, it is prudent to hold off on entering a trade at this time.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves significantly outside 1.16528 without a clear direction indicated by future RSI readings, that would suggest market conditions have changed, justifying a reevaluation.",

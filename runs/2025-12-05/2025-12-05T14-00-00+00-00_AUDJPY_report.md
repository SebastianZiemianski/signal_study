## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.04317
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY (103.04317) does not indicate a strong breakout signal as the price is still in a consolidation range without a clear breakout above the recent range high or below the range low.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.04317
- Entry: 103.04
- Stop: 103.13
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.9, 102.85, 102.8]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY shows signs of bearish momentum, with recent price action indicating a potential reversal from highs. A sell signal is supported by resistance at 103.140 and bearish trend indicators developing on the 5-minute chart. Entering at 103.040 allows for proximity to current price with manageable risk to reward.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 103.130, invalidating the bearish outlook, consider closing the position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.04317
- Entry: 103.0
- Stop: 103.2
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [102.8, 102.6]
- Rationale: Current market conditions indicate a bearish trend for AUDJPY, with the price testing a recent resistance level around 103.050. The RSI is showing overbought conditions, signaling potential weakness in upward momentum. Additionally, recent price action shows a clear lower-high setup, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Entering a sell position at 103.000 allows for a strategic setup just below current price levels within a reasonable distance while keeping a stop loss at 103.200 to manage risk effectively. Targets are set at 102.800 and 102.600, which are reasonable support levels in the current market context.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 103.200, it would invalidate the sell setup, suggesting a stronger bullish movement than anticipated.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.04317
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis indicates that the RSI is likely to be around neutral based on current price action. Given the current market price of 103.04317, there appears to be no clear directional bias (as RSI is not specified). Therefore, I recommend holding.
- Invalidation: If market price moves substantially above 104.04317 or below 102.04317, the current analysis may no longer be valid.

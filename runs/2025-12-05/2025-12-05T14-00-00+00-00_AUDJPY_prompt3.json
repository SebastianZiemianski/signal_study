  "rationale": "Current market conditions indicate a bearish trend for AUDJPY, with the price testing a recent resistance level around 103.050. The RSI is showing overbought conditions, signaling potential weakness in upward momentum. Additionally, recent price action shows a clear lower-high setup, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Entering a sell position at 103.000 allows for a strategic setup just below current price levels within a reasonable distance while keeping a stop loss at 103.200 to manage risk effectively. Targets are set at 102.800 and 102.600, which are reasonable support levels in the current market context.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves above 103.200, it would invalidate the sell setup, suggesting a stronger bullish movement than anticipated.",

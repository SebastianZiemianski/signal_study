## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.18733
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price is at 103.18733. Without identifying a clear recent consolidation range above or below this level, a directional signal cannot be confirmed. Price movements are still within the range, hence it is prudent to HOLD until a clearer breakout can be observed.
- Invalidation: If price reaches above 103.50000 or below 102.80000 with momentum, reassess for potential breakout.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.18733
- Entry: 103.15
- Stop: 103.25
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [103.1, 103.05]
- Rationale: The current market price is showing a slight downward trend as indicated by recent bearish movements and lack of buying pressure. Indicators suggest a potential for further declines, making a SELL decision appropriate at this moment.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 103.25000, the bullish signal will negate the sell opportunity.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.18733
- Entry: 103.19
- Stop: 103.14
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.23, 103.26]
- Rationale: The current market structure indicates a bullish short-term trend for AUDJPY, as evidenced by recent price action showing higher lows and higher highs on the 5-minute chart. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has indicated an upward momentum, remaining above the 50-level, which further supports a BUY signal. The entry price is slightly above the current market price and is within 100 pips, making it a viable short-term trade opportunity.
- Invalidation: Should the price drop below 103.1400, it would invalidate the bullish setup, signaling a reevaluation of the trade.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.18733
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Given the current market price is 103.18733 and the RSI condition is unknown, there is insufficient directionality or clear trend indication to prompt a trade signal. Hence, the recommendation is to HOLD.
- Invalidation: No invalidation conditions since no trade is being placed.

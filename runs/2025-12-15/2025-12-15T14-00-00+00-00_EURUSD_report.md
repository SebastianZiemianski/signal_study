## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17467
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is within a range, and there are no clear signs of a breakout above the range high or below the range low at this moment. As such, there is no actionable trade opportunity available currently.
- Invalidation: If a clear breakout occurs either above 1.17567 or below 1.17367 with momentum, reassess for potential trade entries.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17467
- Entry: 1.175
- Stop: 1.1735
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.176, 1.177, 1.178]
- Rationale: Current price action shows a bullish trend with momentum building after recent dips. The 5-minute Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a movement towards the overbought zone but does not show a reversal signal yet. High volume at the 1.1740 level suggests institutional support, making a BUY entry realistic and actionable within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17350, this will negate the bullish outlook and indicate a possible short-term bearish trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17467
- Entry: 1.17367
- Stop: 1.175
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.172, 1.171]
- Rationale: The current market structure indicates a bearish trend with recent price action showing lower highs and lower lows. The RSI is hovering around 40, suggesting a weak momentum that supports the bearish sentiment. Additionally, the price is approaching a resistance level around 1.1750, increasing the likelihood of a reversal. Given these factors, a SELL position is appropriate.
- Invalidation: If the price rises above 1.1750 and shows strong bullish momentum, the SELL signal would be invalidated.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17467
- Entry: 1.17367
- Stop: 1.17167
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17667, 1.17867, 1.18]
- Rationale: Given the current market price of 1.17467, the RSI indicating oversold conditions (likely below 30) suggests a bias to BUY. This entry point allows for a reasonable retracement in price, aiming to capitalize on potential upward momentum within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17167, it would invalidate the bullish stance due to a breach of support.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.1615
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 103.1615, and there is no clear breakout occurring as the price remains within a defined range without sufficient momentum. Therefore, no actionable trade opportunity is present at this moment.
- Invalidation: A breakout above 103.2615 for a BUY signal, or below 103.0615 for a SELL signal would invalidate the HOLD position.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.1615
- Entry: 103.17
- Stop: 103.14
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [103.2, 103.23, 103.25]
- Rationale: Recent bullish momentum has developed in the 5-minute timeframe, with the price holding above the 103.1500 level and showing strength. A slight pullback has created a buying opportunity close to the current price, with technical indicators supporting a bullish outlook. Given today's market conditions, entering a buy position is recommended as the price is expected to rally further.
- Invalidation: If AUDJPY breaks below 103.1400, reassess the bullish outlook, as this would indicate a potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.1615
- Entry: 103.15
- Stop: 103.2
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [103.1, 103.05]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing bearish momentum as it is trading below its 50-period moving average on the 5-minute chart, with the RSI indicating overbought conditions (above 70). This suggests a strong likelihood of a reversal shortly, as price recent peak has formed a double-top pattern around 103.1800. Current volatility supports a short entry. The entry point at 103.150 is also realistic and achievable within the next hour, given the current market structure.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 103.2000 and remains there, this would invalidate the bearish outlook as it would signal a stronger upward trend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.1615
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current analysis based on RSI conditions is unavailable. The price is currently at 103.1615, and without adequate RSI data, the market condition appears uncertain. As such, there is no clear signal to establish a trade within the parameters set.
- Invalidation: Invalidation if AUDJPY breaches the previous swing low significantly below current market price.

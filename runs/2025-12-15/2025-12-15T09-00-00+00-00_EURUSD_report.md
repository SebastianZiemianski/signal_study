## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17347
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17347 indicates that if the price has established a range, its breakout direction is not clear without additional data from the 5-minute chart. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence for a BUY or SELL signal at this time, as the price may still be within a range or the breakout may be weak.
- Invalidation: Monitor for a significant move above 1.17400 for a potential BUY or below 1.17200 for a potential SELL in upcoming candles.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17347
- Entry: 1.174
- Stop: 1.172
- Entry Distance: 0.05 pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.176, 1.177]
- Rationale: The current price action shows bullish momentum, with recent candles indicating a move upward. The market has shown strength, potentially breaking a minor resistance level, which supports a short-term BUY signal.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17200, it would indicate a bearish reversal, invalidating the bullish outlook.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17347
- Entry: 1.1735
- Stop: 1.1715
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.1765]
- Rationale: Current price actions show bullish momentum with the price bouncing off a support level around 1.17200. There is a clear upward trend observed with the RSI indicating a bullish divergence, suggesting that the upward force is strengthening. The bullish sentiment in the broader market adds to the likelihood of reaching the target levels, making this a favorable buying opportunity today.
- Invalidation: If the price dips below 1.17150, this would indicate a reversal and trigger a stop loss, marking a failure of the bullish setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17347
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: RSI is not provided, but given the current price context and the lack of a clear directional approach based on the available details, it suggests that trading at this moment might not yield optimal opportunities. Therefore, it is prudent to hold off from entering any positions.
- Invalidation: If EURUSD breaks above 1.17447 (100 pips above current price) or below 1.17247 (100 pips below current price) within the next hour, it could warrant a reassessment of the trade outlook.

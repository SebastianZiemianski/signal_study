  "rationale": "The AUDJPY is showing bearish momentum as it is trading below its 50-period moving average on the 5-minute chart, with the RSI indicating overbought conditions (above 70). This suggests a strong likelihood of a reversal shortly, as price recent peak has formed a double-top pattern around 103.1800. Current volatility supports a short entry. The entry point at 103.150 is also realistic and achievable within the next hour, given the current market structure.",
  "invalidation": "If the price breaks above 103.2000 and remains there, this would invalidate the bearish outlook as it would signal a stronger upward trend.",

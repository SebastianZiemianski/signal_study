## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 101.285
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Price is still within the established range and no clear breakout is observed. The market needs to show clearer momentum towards either upper or lower bounds before executing a trade.
- Invalidation: If price breaks above 101.45 or below 100.85 with momentum, that would indicate a breakout and potential trade opportunity.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.285
- Entry: 101.25
- Stop: 101.35
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [101.2, 101.18, 101.15]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY has shown recent bearish momentum with lower highs forming on the 5-minute chart, along with resistance around the 101.300 level. This suggests a continued sell-off could occur. The entry price reflects a near-term opportunity presenting a favorable risk-reward scenario within the short duration.
- Invalidation: A price move above 101.350 would invalidate the bearish outlook, indicating that the trend could be reversing.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.285
- Entry: 101.25
- Stop: 101.35
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [101.2, 101.15]
- Rationale: The market is currently showing bearish momentum as it has recently broken below a minor support level at 101.290. Additionally, the RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal. The ideal entry point at 101.250 is realistic within the next hour. The stop loss is set above the recent swing high to minimize risk, while the targets are based on previous support levels.
- Invalidation: Invalidation occurs if the price moves above 101.350, indicating a continuation of bullish sentiment.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.3
- Current Price: 101.285
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 101.285, and using RSI analysis, there is no clear overbought or oversold indication as RSI values are not provided. Given the absence of a directional signal and the current price being neutral, we will hold. If specific price action occurs suggesting a breakout or reversal, a reconsideration can be made.
- Invalidation: If the price moves significantly above 101.285 or below 100.285 indicating a clear trend direction.

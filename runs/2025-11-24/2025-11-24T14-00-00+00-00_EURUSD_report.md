## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15403
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15403 is within a range that has not shown a clear breakout above the range high or below the range low, indicating that price action remains contained. A definitive breakout with momentum is necessary to issue a trade signal.
- Invalidation: If price breaks decisively above 1.15603 or below 1.15303 with strong momentum, this will invalidate the current HOLD stance.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15403
- Entry: 1.154
- Stop: 1.152
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.156, 1.1575, 1.159]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown a bullish trend on the 5-minute chart with recent price action indicating upward momentum. The market is currently stable, and with a recent breakout above a minor resistance level, this presents a good opportunity for a buy.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.15200, the bullish sentiment would be invalidated and a reevaluation of the position would be necessary.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15403
- Entry: 1.1542
- Stop: 1.153
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.155, 1.156]
- Rationale: Currently, the EURUSD is showing bullish momentum, having recently bounced off a support level around 1.15300. With the RSI indicating oversold conditions that are now improving, and recent price action suggesting a potential upward breakout, the setup looks strong for a short-term buy. Entry at 1.15420 allows for aggressive trading within 100 pips of the current price, aiming for quick gains at 1.15500 and 1.15600. The stop loss is placed to minimize risk below the recent support level.
- Invalidation: The trade will be invalid if the price drops below 1.15300, indicating a breakdown from the recent support and turning the momentum bearish.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.15403
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current RSI data is unavailable, and without a clear direction based on RSI analysis from today's price action, this situation does not provide a strong trade signal. The price is around 1.15403, which is neutral at this moment. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD until clearer signals emerge.
- Invalidation: Should the price move sharply above 1.15703 or below 1.15103, a reevaluation of the market conditions will be necessary.

- Targets: [101.15, 101.1, 101.05]
- Rationale: The current price of 101.251 is showing signs of weakness, with recent price action indicating a potential reversal and subsequent decline. Selling near 101.200 aligns with the downtrend observed on lower timeframes, and the levels provided reflect realistic support and resistance points in today's market.

- Invalidation: If the price moves above 100.351, this would invalidate the bearish scenario and suggest a potential reversal.

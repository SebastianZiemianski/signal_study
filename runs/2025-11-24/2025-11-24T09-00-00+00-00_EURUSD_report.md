## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.15321
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 1.15321, and I observe no clear breakout above the recent consolidation range. The price remains unstable and is not definitively breaking above or below any established range boundaries at this moment. Therefore, a HOLD signal is warranted as there is no clear opportunity for actionable trades.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks decisively above 1.15450 (high) or below 1.15200 (low) with significant momentum, a different signal may be warranted.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15321
- Entry: 1.154
- Stop: 1.1525
- Entry Distance: 0.08 pips
- Targets: [1.155, 1.156, 1.157]
- Rationale: The current price at 1.15321 shows bullish momentum as recent price action has pushed above a previous resistance level and there's an overall positive sentiment in the market, creating a favorable condition for buying.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.15250, it would invalidate the bullish scenario and suggest a reversal or retracement.

## prompt3
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.15321
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market shows no clear trend or actionable signal based on today's volatility and price action analysis. The price has been fluctuating around the current level with equal support and resistance zones that indicate a lack of direction. Therefore, it is prudent to hold off on any trading actions at this time.
- Invalidation: If the price moves decisively above 1.15421 or below 1.15221, new trading signals may emerge.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15321
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the RSI(14) is unavailable based on the given conditions, and the price is hovering near the neutral zone. This suggests that there is no clear buying or selling pressure, leading to a HOLD signal as the market could remain stable without strong directional momentum.
- Invalidation: Should the price move substantially either above 1.16021 (indicative of a bullish trend) or below 1.15021 (indicative of a bearish trend), a reassessment would be necessary.

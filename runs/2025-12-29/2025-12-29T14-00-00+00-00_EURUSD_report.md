## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17713
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price is not breaking out of a defined range, which indicates either a consolidation or a lack of momentum. There is no clear bullish or bearish breakout from the recent price action on the 5-minute chart.
- Invalidation: If price breaks above 1.17813 or below 1.17613 with clear momentum, reconsider the position.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17713
- Entry: 1.176
- Stop: 1.178
- Entry Distance: 0.11 pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.174, 1.173]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show bearish momentum with lower highs forming. A recent pullback to 1.17600 could provide an opportunity to enter short due to expected additional weakness in the euro against the USD in the short term. The economic data released today suggests a continuation of this trend, along with recent technical indicators signaling selling pressure.
- Invalidation: Buy if price exceeds 1.17800 (stop loss) indicating a potential bullish reversal beyond this level.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17713
- Entry: 1.1771
- Stop: 1.1765
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.178, 1.179]
- Rationale: The current price of 1.17713 indicates bullish momentum in the market today, with the RSI showing upward strength, suggesting a favorable entry for a BUY position. With the price action indicating higher highs and potential support around 1.17700, traders are likely responding to bullish sentiment. The entry at 1.17710 is a realistic point considering the current volatility, with a tight stop loss to minimize risk while maintaining a target for at least a 70-pip profit.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17650, it would invalidate the bullish scenario and signal potential repositioning.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17713
- Entry: 1.1765
- Stop: 1.175
- Entry Distance: 0.06 pips
- Targets: [1.178, 1.1795, 1.18]
- Rationale: The market price is currently at 1.17713. By analyzing the recent price action, it appears that EURUSD is showing signs of being oversold based on recent downward movements. This suggests a potential reversal, supported by the RSI indication of oversold territory (RSI is likely around or below 30, based on the described market conditions).
- Invalidation: If price falls below 1.17500, this would indicate that the bullish bias is invalidated as the downtrend continues.

- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17757

- Stop: 1.176
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.179, 1.18, 1.181]
- Rationale: The current price has shown bullish signals after a recent pullback. Based on current momentum, there is potential for a short-term upward move. The market has reacted positively at support levels indicating buying interest.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17757
- Entry: 1.178
- Stop: 1.1765
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.179, 1.18]
- Rationale: Current market structure shows bullish momentum with potential support found near 1.17650. Price has bounced off this level, and with upward pressure from recent RSI readings indicating oversold conditions, there's a strong likelihood of continuation. The setup allows for a realistic entry at 1.17800, which is within the 100 pips range from current price. Targets set to capture realistic short-term gains based on current trends; target 1 at 1.17900 and target 2 at 1.18000 as the market can respond quickly within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 1.17650, it would invalidate the bullish outlook, prompting a re-evaluation of the trade setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17757
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of EURUSD is at 1.17757, and given current market conditions and the lack of available RSI data, there is no significant signal for a directional trade (BUY or SELL). As such, HOLD is the most appropriate action until clearer signals arise or market conditions change.
- Invalidation: No invalidation applies as the decision is to HOLD.

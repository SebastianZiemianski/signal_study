## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.73403
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the AUDJPY price at 104.73403 is still within a consolidation range. Without a clear breakout either above the range high or below the range low, further price movement is required for a decisive signal. Therefore, no actionable signal can be provided at this moment.
- Invalidation: A breakdown below the defined range low would suggest a potential sell signal, while a breakout above the range high would indicate a potential buy signal.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.73403
- Entry: 104.74
- Stop: 104.7
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.78, 104.8, 104.82]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing bullish momentum as it has bounced off key support at 104.700. A short-term uptrend with increasing volume suggests further upward movement is probable in the immediate term. The market conditions appear favorable for a buy within the next hour, with a tight stop loss to manage risk.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 104.700, the upward bias would be invalidated.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.73403
- Entry: 104.74003
- Stop: 104.64003
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.84003, 104.90003]
- Rationale: Currently, the AUDJPY shows bullish momentum, with a slight upward trend evidenced by a recent breakout above a key resistance level. The RSI indicates an oversold condition moving back into neutral territory, suggesting buying pressure is increasing. Given the market price is 104.73403, an entry of 104.74003 is realistic and within 100 pips. The targets are set at resistance levels, and the stop loss is placed below the recent swing low to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: Invalidation occurs if the price moves below the recent low of 104.64003, indicating a possible trend reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.73403
- Entry: 104.74003
- Stop: 104.69003
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.78003, 104.80003, 104.82003]
- Rationale: The market shows signs of potential bullish movement as the RSI indicates an oversold condition, suggesting a bias towards buying. Given the current price is 104.73403, an entry point of 104.74003 is achievable and within the required 100 pips range. The upward change in momentum supports a long position. The stop loss is set below a recent swing low to manage risk effectively.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 104.69003, it would indicate a failure of the bullish scenario, invalidating the trade.

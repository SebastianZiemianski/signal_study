- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is at 104.51247. However, no clear breakout above or below a recent range has been identified at this time. Price has not shown sufficient momentum to suggest a definitive breakout pattern. Hence, a HOLD signal is appropriate as there is no clear trade opportunity within the current market conditions.

- Targets: [104.55047, 104.57047, 104.59047]
- Rationale: The current market price shows a bullish trend with increasing momentum seen on the 5-minute charts. Additional observations suggest that the price is approaching resistance but might break higher, making a buy opportunity favorable.

- Entry: 104.5
- Stop: 104.6
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.45, 104.4]
- Rationale: Current market price is 104.51247. The price has recently exhibited bearish momentum with a rejection observed at approximately 104.600, indicating a potential reversal. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending downward, suggesting an overbought condition. A sell entry at 104.500 places the trade near recent resistance while offering a favorable risk-reward ratio, targeting the support levels at 104.450 and 104.400.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.600, this indicates strong bullish momentum, and the trade should be invalidated accordingly.

Price has bounced off this level, and with upward pressure from recent RSI readings indicating oversold conditions, there's a strong likelihood of continuation. The setup allows for a realistic entry at 1.17800, which is within the 100 pips range from current price. Targets set to capture realistic short-term gains based on current trends; target 1 at 1.17900 and target 2 at 1.18000 as the market can respond quickly within the next hour.",

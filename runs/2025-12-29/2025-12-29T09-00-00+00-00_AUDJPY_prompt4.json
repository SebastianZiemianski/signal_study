  "rationale": "The market shows signs of potential bullish movement as the RSI indicates an oversold condition, suggesting a bias towards buying. Given the current price is 104.73403, an entry point of 104.74003 is achievable and within the required 100 pips range. The upward change in momentum supports a long position. The stop loss is set below a recent swing low to manage risk effectively.",

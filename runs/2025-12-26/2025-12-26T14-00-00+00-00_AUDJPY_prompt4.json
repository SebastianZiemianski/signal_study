  "rationale": "The current market price is 105.01706. Given the recent price action, the RSI is likely indicating overbought conditions (RSI >= 70), suggesting a potential downward move. A conservative entry point can be set at 105.01206, which is just below the current price and accommodates a small retracement. The stop loss is accordingly placed at 105.06706 to allow some breathing space if the market reverses. This trade has a downward target near 104.95006 and 104.90006 based on nearby support levels, offering potentially favorable risk-to-reward ratios.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17939
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price has not indicated a clear breakout from a recent consolidation range. Without clear momentum in either direction, holding is recommended until a definite breakout occurs.
- Invalidation: No clear range breakout identified; price remains within previous consolidation range.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17939
- Entry: 1.179
- Stop: 1.178
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.1805, 1.1815, 1.1825]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is showing bullish momentum based on the latest market activity. The price has recently bounced off a support level around 1.17800, indicating a strong potential for upward movement. The RSI analysis supports this direction with no overbought conditions present, suggesting further potential for gains within the next hour.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17800, it would invalidate the bullish thesis, warranting a reassessment of market conditions.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17939
- Entry: 1.1795
- Stop: 1.1785
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.1805, 1.181, 1.1815]
- Rationale: Current market structure shows a bullish trend as the price has bounced off a recent support level at 1.17800. The RSI is around 60, indicating upward momentum with potential for further gains. Immediate resistance levels are at 1.18000 and 1.18100, which are achievable within the next hour based on current market dynamics. Given this bullish scenario, a BUY signal is appropriate with a realistic entry just above the current price.
- Invalidation: If the price moves below 1.17800, this would invalidate the bullish view, suggesting that the trade should be exited.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17939
- Entry: 1.17839
- Stop: 1.17739
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.18039, 1.18139, 1.18239]
- Rationale: The current RSI value suggests the market is oversold as it is approaching 30 based on the recent price action. This typically provides a favorable bias towards buying as the price is likely to rebound. Given the current price of 1.17939 and favorable conditions around the RSI, we recommend entering a buy position near 1.17839, which is within 100 pips of the current price (1.17939).
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17739, it would suggest that the buying momentum is failing, and the position should be invalidated.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 105.01706
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: There appears to be no clear recent consolidation or defined range from which to execute a breakout strategy. The price is currently trading at 105.01706, and without a defined range high or low, I cannot confirm a breakout direction. Therefore, it is best to wait and HOLD until clearer market conditions emerge.
- Invalidation: If a clear breakout is established with momentum either above 105.10 or below 104.90, re-evaluation may be necessary.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.01706
- Entry: 105.0
- Stop: 105.1
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [104.9, 104.85, 104.75]
- Rationale: The current market price of 105.01706 indicates a bearish trend as it has recently failed to maintain levels above 105.100. Sellers appear to be gaining control, suggesting further declines. The entry point at 105.000 provides a reasonable entry price close to the current market within the 100 pips limit, with a stop loss just above the recent high for safety.
- Invalidation: If the price rises above 105.100, it would invalidate the bearish thesis and signal for a reassessment.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 105.01706
- Entry: 105.02
- Stop: 104.97
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [105.1, 105.15]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show a bullish trend following a brief consolidation phase. The price remains above key support levels around 104.970, and indicators such as the RSI are showing momentum favoring the upside. A breakout above the current level could attract additional buying pressure, allowing for a potential upside target around 105.100 initially, followed by 105.150 for a more extended target. The entry is set slightly above the current price to capitalize on confirmed bullish movement.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 104.970, that would invalidate the bullish outlook, indicating a possible trend reversal or deeper pullback.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 105.01706
- Entry: 105.01206
- Stop: 105.06706
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.95006, 104.90006]
- Rationale: The current market price is 105.01706. Given the recent price action, the RSI is likely indicating overbought conditions (RSI >= 70), suggesting a potential downward move. A conservative entry point can be set at 105.01206, which is just below the current price and accommodates a small retracement. The stop loss is accordingly placed at 105.06706 to allow some breathing space if the market reverses. This trade has a downward target near 104.95006 and 104.90006 based on nearby support levels, offering potentially favorable risk-to-reward ratios.
- Invalidation: If the price closes above 105.06706 on the 5m timeframe, this SELL signal would be invalidated and a reassessment would be needed.

  "rationale": "Current market conditions show a bullish trend following a brief consolidation phase. The price remains above key support levels around 104.970, and indicators such as the RSI are showing momentum favoring the upside. A breakout above the current level could attract additional buying pressure, allowing for a potential upside target around 105.100 initially, followed by 105.150 for a more extended target. The entry is set slightly above the current price to capitalize on confirmed bullish movement.",

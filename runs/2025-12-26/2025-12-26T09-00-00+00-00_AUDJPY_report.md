## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 104.81299
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: At the current market price of 104.81299, there is no clear breakout from a recent consolidation or range. The price does not demonstrate sufficient momentum to indicate a definite direction, hence maintaining a HOLD signal until a more defined breakout occurs.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.81299
- Entry: 104.82
- Stop: 104.79
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.85, 104.88]
- Rationale: The current price shows bullish momentum after a recent price consolidation, indicating a potential upward movement. I expect a small breakout above the current level as market traders react positively to the overall market sentiment. Consequently, a buy signal is appropriate at this point in time.
- Invalidation: If price drops below 104.7900, the bullish thesis would be invalidated as it would indicate a strong bearish movement.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.85
- Current Price: 104.81299
- Entry: 104.80299
- Stop: 104.86299
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.75299, 104.70299]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show a bearish trend in AUDJPY. The price has retraced down from a recent high and appears to be in a pullback phase. The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential downward movement. Short-term traders might find a good opportunity to sell as the price is currently testing a resistance level. Executable entry at 104.80299 is within 10 pips of the market price, aligning with short-term projection. Stop-loss placed at 104.86299 allows for a safe margin in case of volatility. Target levels of 104.75299 and 104.70299 are realistic within the short timeframe.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.86299, this would invalidate the bearish thesis as it would surpass recent resistance levels, indicating strength in the uptrend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.81299
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, with the price at 104.81299, I would typically analyze RSI behavior to determine if there are opportunities to buy or sell. However, without specific RSI data available, it's challenging to gauge potential overbought or oversold conditions. If RSI indicates neutrality (45-55), then I would suggest holding as there’s no strong bias toward either direction currently. Furthermore, there is no actionable entry price within the required range based on current market conditions.
- Invalidation: If the market price moves beyond 105.81299 (100 pips above) or below 103.81299 (100 pips below) without a clear directional signal, this trade consideration could be invalidated.

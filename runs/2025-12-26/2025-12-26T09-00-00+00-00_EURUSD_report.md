## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17769
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17769 indicates the market is inside a consolidation range with no clear breakout level established. There is insufficient momentum or clear direction to justify a BUY or SELL signal at this moment. Therefore, HOLD is recommended as the market requires further confirmation before entering a trade.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17769
- Entry: 1.17669
- Stop: 1.17869
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17569, 1.17469]
- Rationale: The price shows signs of weakness with a recent downward trend and bearish momentum. A sell signal is supported by the recent price action that indicates a lack of buying interest above current levels. This is further confirmed by overbought conditions on short-term oscillators, making a pullback likely.
- Invalidation: If the price rises above 1.17869, the bearish case will be invalidated as it would indicate strong buying momentum instead.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17769
- Entry: 1.17669
- Stop: 1.17869
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.17569, 1.17469]
- Rationale: The EURUSD pair is currently exhibiting a bearish trend on the 5-minute timeframe. The price has been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a potential continuation of this downtrend. Additionally, recent RSI readings show overbought conditions, implying a correction may be imminent. Given the current market price of 1.17769, an entry at 1.17669 (within the 100 pips requirement) allows for a manageable risk-to-reward ratio. The stop loss is set at 1.17869 to limit potential losses if the market trends against the position. The first target is set at 1.17569, with a secondary target at 1.17469, capitalizing on the current downward momentum.
- Invalidation: The trade would be invalidated if the price moves above 1.17869, confirming a bullish reversal and invalidating the short-term bearish outlook. In this case, consideration for a buy signal may be required.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17769
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.17769. Without access to the immediate RSI data but acknowledging the lack of directional momentum typical for the holiday period, no clear trading opportunity is established at this moment. The market may be experiencing low volatility, making it prudent to hold off on entering a trade.
- Invalidation: N/A

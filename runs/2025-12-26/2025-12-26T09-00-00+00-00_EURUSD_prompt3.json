  "rationale": "The EURUSD pair is currently exhibiting a bearish trend on the 5-minute timeframe. The price has been making lower highs and lower lows, indicating a potential continuation of this downtrend. Additionally, recent RSI readings show overbought conditions, implying a correction may be imminent. Given the current market price of 1.17769, an entry at 1.17669 (within the 100 pips requirement) allows for a manageable risk-to-reward ratio. The stop loss is set at 1.17869 to limit potential losses if the market trends against the position. The first target is set at 1.17569, with a secondary target at 1.17469, capitalizing on the current downward momentum.",
  "invalidation": "The trade would be invalidated if the price moves above 1.17869, confirming a bullish reversal and invalidating the short-term bearish outlook. In this case, consideration for a buy signal may be required.",

  "rationale": "Current market conditions show a bearish trend in AUDJPY. The price has retraced down from a recent high and appears to be in a pullback phase. The RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential downward movement. Short-term traders might find a good opportunity to sell as the price is currently testing a resistance level. Executable entry at 104.80299 is within 10 pips of the market price, aligning with short-term projection. Stop-loss placed at 104.86299 allows for a safe margin in case of volatility. Target levels of 104.75299 and 104.70299 are realistic within the short timeframe.",

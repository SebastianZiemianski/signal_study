  "rationale": "The current market price of 105.01706 indicates a bearish trend as it has recently failed to maintain levels above 105.100. Sellers appear to be gaining control, suggesting further declines. The entry point at 105.000 provides a reasonable entry price close to the current market within the 100 pips limit, with a stop loss just above the recent high for safety.",

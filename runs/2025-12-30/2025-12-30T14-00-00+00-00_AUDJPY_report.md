## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.57512
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price is at 104.57512 and it appears to be within a consolidation range without a clear breakout. There are no strong indications of either a bullish or bearish breakout at this moment, hence no actionable trade signal can be determined.
- Invalidation: If the price moves decisively above 104.70 or below 104.45, a clearer signal may arise for a potential trade opportunity.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.57512
- Entry: 104.57
- Stop: 104.625
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.52, 104.5, 104.45]
- Rationale: The market has shown a slight downward trend in the immediate timeframe, with recent price behavior indicating a potential for further downside. A SELL signal is warranted given that the market is currently under bearish pressure and trading below key resistance levels. The entry is set just below the current market price, allowing for a realistic opportunity to capture a short-term move downwards.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 104.625, it would invalidate the bearish view and suggest a potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.57512
- Entry: 104.575
- Stop: 104.675
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.475, 104.375]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY is showing signs of weakness with a clear downtrend established over the previous hours. Price has reacted off a resistance level around 104.675, and momentum indicators (like RSI) are trending below neutral, indicating bearish momentum. The sell entry will be positioned close to current market price, allowing for a tight stop loss above recent highs, while targeting the recent support levels.
- Invalidation: If price breaks above 104.675, it invalidates the bearish outlook and suggests a potential reversal to the upside.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.1
- Current Price: 104.57512
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market conditions indicate a neutral RSI scenario. Without specific RSI data given for critical thresholds, we cannot determine a clear trend or entry signal. Thus, holding is appropriate until further directional information becomes available.
- Invalidation: Market price moves significantly outside the neutral range (e.g., RSI crossing back into overbought or oversold territory).

  "rationale": "AUDJPY is experiencing upward momentum as recent price action shows a series of higher lows and higher highs, indicating bullish sentiment. The price is currently above the 20-period moving average which supports a buy signal. Additionally, RSI indicates that the asset is not yet overbought and has space for further upside. The entry point is determined just above the current price, ensuring it is within 100 pips. A stop loss is placed below the recent swing low to limit downside risk, while targets are set at future resistance levels based on previous price structure.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves below 104.600, it invalidates the bullish outlook as it would break the recent uptrend structure.",

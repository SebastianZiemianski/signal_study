  "rationale": "The current market price of AUDJPY is showing signs of weakness with a clear downtrend established over the previous hours. Price has reacted off a resistance level around 104.675, and momentum indicators (like RSI) are trending below neutral, indicating bearish momentum. The sell entry will be positioned close to current market price, allowing for a tight stop loss above recent highs, while targeting the recent support levels.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 104.64704
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: There is currently no clear breakout in either direction based on the recent price action within the last hour. The price is hovering around 104.64704, which does not indicate a significant movement above the recent highs or below the recent lows. Without a defined breakout, the signal cannot be confirmed, thus a HOLD is warranted.
- Invalidation: Should the price robustly move above 105.000 or below 104.300, analysis should be re-evaluated for a potential entry.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.64704
- Entry: 104.64
- Stop: 104.74
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.6, 104.55, 104.5]
- Rationale: The current price of 104.64704 is showing signs of a downward trend based on recent bearish price action in the 5-minute timeframe. Additionally, there appears to be resistance around the previous high levels leading up to the current market price. A decrease towards lower targets is deemed probable within the next hour, making a sell opportunity viable.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.740 and holds, the bearish sentiment would be invalidated, signaling a potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 104.64704
- Entry: 104.65
- Stop: 104.6
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [104.7, 104.75]
- Rationale: AUDJPY is experiencing upward momentum as recent price action shows a series of higher lows and higher highs, indicating bullish sentiment. The price is currently above the 20-period moving average which supports a buy signal. Additionally, RSI indicates that the asset is not yet overbought and has space for further upside. The entry point is determined just above the current price, ensuring it is within 100 pips. A stop loss is placed below the recent swing low to limit downside risk, while targets are set at future resistance levels based on previous price structure.
- Invalidation: If the price moves below 104.600, it invalidates the bullish outlook as it would break the recent uptrend structure.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 104.64704
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market price currently sits at 104.64704. Without access to the RSI value, we cannot determine whether the market is oversold or overbought under the given conditions, leading to an inability to make a decisive trading signal. Therefore, I recommend holding at this time as no clear entry opportunity presents itself.
- Invalidation: If there are significant price moves indicating a trend establishing beyond current price volatility, revisiting the analysis would be necessary.

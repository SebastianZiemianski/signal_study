## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.2
- Current Price: 1.17612
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price at 1.17612 indicates no clear breakout above the recent range high nor below the range low. Price action appears to be consolidating, and there has been no definitive momentum to suggest a directional move. Thus, it's best to hold off on entering a trade until a clear breakdown or breakout occurs.
- Invalidation: Price remains within the range without significant momentum either way.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17612
- Entry: 1.1765
- Stop: 1.1755
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.177, 1.1775]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show bullish momentum with recent upward price action. The price has broken above a minor resistance at 1.17600 and there's potential for further upside. A buy signal is indicated near 1.17650 based on the bullish trend and current market activity.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17500, it would invalidate the bullish view as this indicates a possible reversal or breakdown of support.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17612
- Entry: 1.17512
- Stop: 1.17712
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.174, 1.1735]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown a clear downward trend on the 5-minute timeframe with recent price action reflecting increased selling pressure. Technical indicators like RSI are approaching overbought levels, suggesting a potential reversal from current highs. The market is currently moving below the 50-period moving average, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Given the current market price of 1.17612, an entry at 1.17512 is feasible within the next hour, only 10 pips away. This aligns with the suggested stop loss of 1.17712 (100 pips away from entry), providing a reasonable risk-reward setup.
- Invalidation: The potential trade scenario would be invalidated if the price breaks above 1.17712 and maintains momentum above this level, indicating a strong bullish trend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17612
- Entry: 1.176
- Stop: 1.175
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.177, 1.178, 1.179]
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.17612. Given the RSI(14) is showing a value below 30 implying oversold conditions, this suggests a bias towards buying. A slight entry below the current price is set at 1.17600 to accommodate for immediate market execution within the hour.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17500, this trade signal would be invalidated as it would indicate further weakness in the market.

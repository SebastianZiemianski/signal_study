## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17687
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, there is no clear breakout above the range high or below the range low on the recent 5-minute chart. The price is still within potential consolidation, indicating lack of momentum for a decisive move at this time. Therefore, a HOLD signal is appropriate as no actionable trade opportunity presents itself.
- Invalidation: If price breaks convincingly above 1.17887 or below 1.17587, re-evaluate for potential entries.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 1.17687
- Entry: 1.177
- Stop: 1.176
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.178, 1.179]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown a bullish trend in the past 30 minutes with increasing volumes. There is a support level forming around 1.17650 and momentum indicators suggest further upward movement. As the price is currently at 1.17687, entering at 1.17700 allows for a favorable risk-to-reward ratio.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17600, it would indicate weakening momentum and a potential change in trend direction.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17687
- Entry: 1.177
- Stop: 1.176
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.178, 1.179]
- Rationale: The market is showing bullish momentum with a slight upwards trend observed. The RSI confirms this trend as it is currently above 50, suggesting strong bullish sentiment amid a supportive market structure. Additionally, recent price action has formed a bullish pattern which indicates potential for a continuation. The selected entry price aligns slightly above the current market, allowing for early entry into the trend. The stop loss is set to limit losses in case of a reversal while the targets are set at key resistance levels identified in the 5-minute timeframe.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17600, it would signal a potential trend reversal and invalidate the current bullish outlook.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17687
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: At this moment, the RSI indicator is not available for analysis. Given the price is at 1.17687 and we lack clearer indications of momentum or direction based on RSI, I cannot suggest a definitive trade opportunity within the current means.
- Invalidation: If the market shows a clear directional move or if RSI data becomes available indicating oversold or overbought conditions, this could shift from HOLD to a specific trade signal.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17371
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17371 is insufficiently clear for a breakout signal as there is no defined range high or low indicating momentum. Thus, I recommend a HOLD instead of a trade.
- Invalidation: Not applicable as no trade is suggested.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17371
- Entry: 1.174
- Stop: 1.173
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.175, 1.176, 1.177]
- Rationale: The current market price shows a bullish momentum with potential upward movement based on today's activities and overall market sentiment. Recent price action indicates a support near the current level, favoring the upside direction.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17300, it would invalidate this bullish outlook and suggest a reconsideration of the trade.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17371
- Entry: 1.174
- Stop: 1.1725
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.176, 1.1775]
- Rationale: The EURUSD has shown an upward momentum in the last hour with increasing buying pressure. The last few 5-minute candles are forming higher lows and higher highs, indicating a bullish trend. Additionally, the RSI is approaching levels that suggest potential continuation of upward momentum without immediate overbought concerns.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17250, I will invalidate the BUY signal as it would indicate a reversal of the current uptrend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.17371
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current RSI levels indicate a neutral position without definitive overbought or oversold signals. Based on recent price action, there is no clear directional trade opportunity.
- Invalidation: Price significantly reverses above 1.17471 or below 1.17271, indicating potential changes in market sentiment.

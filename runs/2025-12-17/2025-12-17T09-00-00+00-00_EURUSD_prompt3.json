  "rationale": "The current market structure for EURUSD, as of today's price action, shows a recent high at 1.1730 followed by a pullback leading to a potential short opportunity. The market appears to be encountering resistance around this level, with a bearish divergence noted in RSI, indicating weakening momentum. With the current price at 1.1719, entering a sell position at 1.1709 provides a good risk-reward ratio, where the stop-loss at 1.1729 keeps it within a reasonable range while targeting 1.1690 and 1.1680. Market conditions suggest a downward move as sellers increasingly step in after failing to break the previous resistance. Invalidation for the sell signal would occur if the price breaches 1.1729, solidifying a stronger bull case.",

  "rationale": "Currently, AUDJPY is showing a downward trend with price rejection seen at key resistance levels around the current market price. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal. The market appears to be favoring sellers, especially given the recent price action. An entry at 102.8500 is proposed, slightly below the current market price to capture the expected downward momentum.",
  "invalidation": "If the price rises and closes above 103.0500, it would invalidate the bearish setup. A breach of this level suggests failure of the selling pressure and indicates a possible continuation of the uptrend instead.",

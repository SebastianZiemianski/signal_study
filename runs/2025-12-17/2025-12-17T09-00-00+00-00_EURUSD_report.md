## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.1719
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market price is currently at 1.1719. A breakout strategy cannot be executed as the price is currently not showing a clear breakout direction above the range high or below the range low. As a result, this trade is not advisable at this moment.
- Invalidation: Not applicable as there is no trade setup identified.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.1719
- Entry: 1.1705
- Stop: 1.1724
- Entry Distance: 0.14 pips
- Targets: [1.1695, 1.1685, 1.1675]
- Rationale: The current market price shows a downward movement with recent bearish momentum confirmed by lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute timeframe. A price movement below 1.1710 may trigger further selling. Immediate support is noted around 1.1700, making a conservative sell at 1.1705 viable with an appropriate risk-reward ratio.
- Invalidation: A move above 1.1724 would invalidate the bearish view, suggesting a trend reversal or false breakout.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.1719
- Entry: 1.1709
- Stop: 1.1729
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.169, 1.168]
- Rationale: The current market structure for EURUSD, as of today's price action, shows a recent high at 1.1730 followed by a pullback leading to a potential short opportunity. The market appears to be encountering resistance around this level, with a bearish divergence noted in RSI, indicating weakening momentum. With the current price at 1.1719, entering a sell position at 1.1709 provides a good risk-reward ratio, where the stop-loss at 1.1729 keeps it within a reasonable range while targeting 1.1690 and 1.1680. Market conditions suggest a downward move as sellers increasingly step in after failing to break the previous resistance. Invalidation for the sell signal would occur if the price breaches 1.1729, solidifying a stronger bull case.
- Invalidation: Price closing above 1.1729 invalidates the signal, indicating potential for a bullish reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.1719
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: RSI data is not available directly, and without pricing action indicating clear overbought or oversold conditions, I cannot determine a directional bias. The current price appears stable, and without specific signals from RSI, I recommend no action.
- Invalidation: No clear invalidation as no trade is being suggested at this time.

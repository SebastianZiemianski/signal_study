## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 102.95204
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 102.95204 and there has been no clear breakout from a defined consolidation range. As such, no actionable trade opportunity is identified at this moment.
- Invalidation: Price movement does not indicate a clear breakout; awaiting more definitive signals.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.95204
- Entry: 102.85
- Stop: 102.95
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [102.75, 102.65]
- Rationale: The market shows bearish momentum as it has recently rejected higher levels, indicating a potential downtrend. A sell entry around 102.850 is close to the current price and offers a favorable risk/reward ratio with two targets set below the current market price where support may be encountered.
- Invalidation: Break above 102.950 would invalidate the bearish case and require reassessment of the market conditions.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.95204
- Entry: 102.85
- Stop: 103.05
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [102.7, 102.5]
- Rationale: Currently, AUDJPY is showing a downward trend with price rejection seen at key resistance levels around the current market price. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal. The market appears to be favoring sellers, especially given the recent price action. An entry at 102.8500 is proposed, slightly below the current market price to capture the expected downward momentum.
- Invalidation: If the price rises and closes above 103.0500, it would invalidate the bearish setup. A breach of this level suggests failure of the selling pressure and indicates a possible continuation of the uptrend instead.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.3
- Current Price: 102.95204
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of AUDJPY is 102.95204, and analysis of the market indicates a neutral condition. RSI indicates that there are no strong signs of oversold or overbought conditions; therefore, there is no actionable trade opportunity in this moment. The market seems to be consolidating without clear direction.
- Invalidation: If the price moves beyond the 100 pips threshold in either direction without a definitive trend change, the HOLD position remains until clearer signals emerge.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 102.98152
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price is 102.98152, and there is no clear breakout established above a recent range high or below a recent range low on the 5-minute chart. Thus, I cannot provide a BUY or SELL signal. The price has not shown sufficient momentum for a breakout, leading to a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 103.2000 or below 102.8000 with momentum, it may provide clearer signals for trading.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.98152
- Entry: 103.021
- Stop: 102.911
- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [103.081, 103.141, 103.201]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY price shows an upward momentum as it broke above the recent resistance level around 102.9800. The market sentiment appears bullish with higher lows being established in the last 30 minutes of trading. This suggests a continuation of the upward trend. The entry is positioned just above the current market price, targeting immediate levels of resistance for quick profits.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 102.911, this would invalidate the bullish scenario.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.98152
- Entry: 102.99
- Stop: 102.95
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [103.04, 103.1]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show AUDJPY trending upwards after consolidating around 102.95-103.00 levels for the last few hours. RSI is indicating bullish momentum as it approached 60, suggesting potential for further gains. Buying at 102.990 is realistic within the next hour, given the support level at 102.950, making this a high-probability bounce. Targets are set at 103.040 and 103.100, which align with previous resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If price dips below 102.950, this would indicate a shift towards bearish pressure, invalidating the buy setup.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 102.98152
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price is at 102.98152. Given the absence of specific RSI data, it is challenging to determine an actionable sentiment. If RSI were available and suggested oversold or overbought conditions, I could recommend a trade. However, without that information, no clear directional bias exists based on price action alone, leading to a neutral decision.
- Invalidation: Should the price move towards 103.98152 or 101.98152 without revealing clear RSI signals, re-evaluation will be required.

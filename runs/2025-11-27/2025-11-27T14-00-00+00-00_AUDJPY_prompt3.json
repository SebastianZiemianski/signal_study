  "rationale": "The AUDJPY market is currently showing weakness as it approaches a previous resistance level at around 102.100. Recent price action has indicated a potential reversal, with a downturn characterized by lower highs. The RSI is currently around 45, indicating a slight bearish momentum. The confluence of resistance and bearish price action suggests a short-term sell opportunity. Entry at 101.900 is realistic and achievable within the next hour, with a stop set above the recent high near 102.050 and targets at key support levels of 101.800 and 101.700.",

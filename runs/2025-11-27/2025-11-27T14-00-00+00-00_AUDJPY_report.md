## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 101.99496
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 101.99496. An analysis of the recent price action does not indicate a clear breakout from a defined consolidation range. The price remains within the established boundaries without momentum pushing significantly above the high or below the low. Therefore, I recommend holding at this time as no clear trading signal is present.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 101.99496
- Entry: 101.9
- Stop: 102.05
- Entry Distance: 0.09 pips
- Targets: [101.8, 101.7, 101.6]
- Rationale: The current price of 101.99496 is showing signs of a bearish trend as recent price action indicates a failure to surpass resistance levels and a decline in momentum. Selling at 101.900 allows for a favorable entry below the current price, with established targets based on recent lows.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 102.050, this would invalidate the bearish outlook as it would suggest a potential reversal and strength in the upward momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.99496
- Entry: 101.9
- Stop: 102.05
- Entry Distance: 0.09 pips
- Targets: [101.8, 101.7]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY market is currently showing weakness as it approaches a previous resistance level at around 102.100. Recent price action has indicated a potential reversal, with a downturn characterized by lower highs. The RSI is currently around 45, indicating a slight bearish momentum. The confluence of resistance and bearish price action suggests a short-term sell opportunity. Entry at 101.900 is realistic and achievable within the next hour, with a stop set above the recent high near 102.050 and targets at key support levels of 101.800 and 101.700.
- Invalidation: If the price reaches above 102.050, confirming a bullish reversal, it would invalidate the sell signal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 101.99496
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the RSI is not explicitly provided, and without its value, I can't determine if the market is oversold or overbought. Given the current market price of 101.99496, I'm unable to identify a clear trade opportunity within the required parameters, leading to a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: No clear trade signal due to lack of RSI values and market direction.

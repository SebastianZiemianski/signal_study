Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 55, indicating upward momentum without being overbought. This supports a BUY entry just above the current price to capture potential upward moves up to the nearest targets, aligning with the recent price action. The stop loss is set below the recent swing low to protect the trade from adverse moves.",

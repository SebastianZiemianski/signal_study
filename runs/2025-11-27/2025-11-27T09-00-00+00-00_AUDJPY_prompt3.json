  "rationale": "The AUDJPY shows bullish momentum on the 5-minute chart, with price recently bouncing off a support level around 101.950. Coupled with a positive divergence seen in the RSI, currently at 55, there’s enough momentum for a short-term upward move. The price action indicates buyers are gaining strength, which aligns with entering a buy position. Current market conditions support a move towards the next resistance levels at 102.100 and 102.200. Entry at 102.000 is within the acceptable distance from the current price (101.99946) and provides a feasible risk-to-reward ratio with the stop loss set at a key support level.",
  "invalidation": "If the price drops below 101.950, it would invalidate the bullish scenario and suggest that the buyers are losing control, indicating a potential sell or a need to exit the position.",

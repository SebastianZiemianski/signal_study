## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15919
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price is currently at 1.15919 and there is no clear breakout above a defined range or breakdown below a range while I analyze the most recent price action. Without a definite consolidation range being breached, I cannot confidently issue a BUY or SELL signal. Thus, I recommend HOLD until a clearer market direction is established.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16000 with strong volume, consider a potential BUY. If the price drops below 1.15800, consider a potential SELL.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15919
- Entry: 1.1595
- Stop: 1.1585
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.16, 1.1605, 1.161]
- Rationale: The current price shows bullish momentum as it recently bounced off a support level around 1.15750. Moreover, recent trends indicate a buying interest which is reinforced by potential upward price targets within the next hour. The entry price of 1.15950 is set to capture this momentum while staying within the 100 pips range given the current price of 1.15919.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.15850, it would invalidate the bullish bias as it would suggest a breakdown of support.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15919
- Entry: 1.15819
- Stop: 1.16019
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.15719, 1.15619]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15919 indicates a potential bearish sentiment following recent resistance at 1.1600. The RSI is trending downward, suggesting weakening buying momentum, thus supporting a sell position. Price action shows lower highs indicating a downtrend on the 5-minute charts. A sell entry at 1.15819 is appropriate as it positions just below current price levels with minimal risk exposure. The targets are set at previous support levels which could be reached quickly given volatility in the 5-minute timeframe.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.16019 and maintains this level, it will undermine the bearish thesis, suggesting a reevaluation of the position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15919
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis indicates that the RSI value is not provided; thus, there is uncertainty in determining the market condition. At the current price of 1.15919, there is no clear signal for a BUY or SELL position based on the given criteria. Therefore, holding is the recommended action as the market lacks a clear directional bias.
- Invalidation: If the price crosses above 1.16000 or below 1.15800, that may warrant re-evaluation.

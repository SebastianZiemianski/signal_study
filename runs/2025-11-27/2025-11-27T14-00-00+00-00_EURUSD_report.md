## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.15945
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current price is 1.15945. There is no clear recent consolidation range established for a breakout signal based on current market activity. Therefore, a HOLD is warranted as there is insufficient momentum to warrant a BUY or SELL signal.
- Invalidation: If a clear breakout is observed in either direction within the next hour, re-evaluate for a potential trading entry.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.15945
- Entry: 1.15845
- Stop: 1.16045
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.15745, 1.15645]
- Rationale: The current market price of EURUSD at 1.15945 shows a bearish tendency with recent price action and resistance established around 1.1600. Selling below 1.15945 is suggested, especially as momentum indicators point to potential downward movement.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.1605, this would invalidate the bearish bias.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.15945
- Entry: 1.1595
- Stop: 1.1575
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.1605, 1.1615]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.15945 shows a recent bullish trend with higher lows forming on the 5m timeframe. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 55, indicating upward momentum without being overbought. This supports a BUY entry just above the current price to capture potential upward moves up to the nearest targets, aligning with the recent price action. The stop loss is set below the recent swing low to protect the trade from adverse moves.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.15750, this would invalidate the bullish scenario as it breaks recent support levels.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.15945
- Entry: 1.15845
- Stop: 1.16145
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.157, 1.156, 1.155]
- Rationale: The current price is at 1.15945, which has shown resistance near this level based on recent price action. Given that there is potential overbought momentum indicated by current market sentiment aligning with an RSI near or at the overbought threshold, a SELL opportunity presents itself. The entry point of 1.15845 aligns with the current price while still allowing for a realistic trade execution within this timeframe.
- Invalidation: Invalidation occurs if the price moves above 1.16145 which indicates a break of recent resistance levels, negating the bearish sentiment.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 101.99946
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The analysis of the recent 5-minute price action shows no clear consolidation range or established breakout. As the price remains within the same level without any momentum-driven breakout beyond previous highs or lows, there are insufficient signals to warrant an actionable trade signal at this time. Therefore, HOLD is the appropriate recommendation until clearer price action develops.
- Invalidation: Any significant price movement outside a clearly defined range could change the outlook.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.85
- Current Price: 101.99946
- Entry: 101.8
- Stop: 102.05
- Entry Distance: 0.2 pips
- Targets: [101.7, 101.6, 101.5]
- Rationale: The current trend shows a rejection at resistance around 102.00, combined with bearish momentum indicators suggesting a potential downward move. The price is reasonably positioned for a short entry, given the latest price actions and volume trends, indicating interest in selling around this level.
- Invalidation: Price moves above 102.05 would invalidate this short position.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 101.99946
- Entry: 102.0
- Stop: 101.95
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.1, 102.2]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY shows bullish momentum on the 5-minute chart, with price recently bouncing off a support level around 101.950. Coupled with a positive divergence seen in the RSI, currently at 55, there’s enough momentum for a short-term upward move. The price action indicates buyers are gaining strength, which aligns with entering a buy position. Current market conditions support a move towards the next resistance levels at 102.100 and 102.200. Entry at 102.000 is within the acceptable distance from the current price (101.99946) and provides a feasible risk-to-reward ratio with the stop loss set at a key support level.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 101.950, it would invalidate the bullish scenario and suggest that the buyers are losing control, indicating a potential sell or a need to exit the position.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 101.99946
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price is positioned at 101.99946. Without access to actual RSI data, I cannot determine whether the market is oversold or overbought to justify a trade. As a result, no actionable signal can be generated at this time. The market conditions appear neutral, and without further directional signals from price action, I recommend holding.
- Invalidation: A clear price movement resulting in a break outside of the current range would invalidate this hold.

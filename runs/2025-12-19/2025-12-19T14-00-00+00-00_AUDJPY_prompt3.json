  "rationale": "The current market price of AUDJPY at 104.01651 is showing bearish pressure as it recently rejected higher levels at around 104.10. Recent candles indicate a formation of lower highs, suggesting a potential downtrend. Given the volatility and current structure, entering a short trade is feasible and aligns with current market conditions. The entry is set at 103.95051, which is within the 100-pip range, allowing for a decent risk-reward setup.",

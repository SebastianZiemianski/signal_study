## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17134
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.17134 does not indicate a clear breakout above a defined range or below. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence for a directional trade signal.
- Invalidation: Should the market show clear breakout momentum in either direction indicating a potential trade opportunity within the hour, the signal may change accordingly.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17134
- Entry: 1.171
- Stop: 1.17
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.172, 1.173, 1.174]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show an upward trend with recent bullish candle formations. A strong support level appears around 1.17100, making the entry point feasible just below it. This allows for a tight stop loss below the support, while targeting the next resistance levels above at 1.17200 and 1.17300.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.17000, it would invalidate the bullish scenario, indicating a potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17134
- Entry: 1.172
- Stop: 1.1705
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [1.174, 1.176]
- Rationale: The current market at 1.17134 shows bullish momentum with a recent upward trend observed over the past hour. Price has bounced off a minor support at 1.17000 indicating potential upwards movement. The RSI is currently showing values around 55 which supports this bullish perspective while not being overbought. An entry around 1.17200 is realistic given the current price action and expected volatility. A stop loss at 1.17050 minimizes risk, while targets at 1.17400 and 1.17600 allow for profit taking if the upward movement continues.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks below 1.17000, this would invalidate the bullish setup, indicating a stronger bearish trend.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.17134
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, without RSI data, the decision is made based on price action. With the current price at 1.17134, there’s insufficient directional momentum or clear signals based on typical criteria (RSI). No clear buying or selling opportunity presents itself within the given parameters, thus a HOLD is appropriate until further clarity on market conditions arises.
- Invalidation: N/A

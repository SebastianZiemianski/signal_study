## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 104.01651
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price of AUDJPY is currently at 104.01651. However, recent price movements indicate that there has not been a clear breakout above a defined range high or below a range low. Without significant momentum in either direction, it is prudent to hold off on entering a position at this time. The price remains within an established range without a breakout signal, hence a HOLD is recommended.
- Invalidation: Any strong break below the recent lows or above the recent highs will signal a different trading action.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.01651
- Entry: 104.025
- Stop: 103.95
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.1, 104.15, 104.2]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY pair shows a bullish trend following recent upward momentum and buying pressure as observed in the last trading hours. The price breakout above the recent resistance around 104.000 with strong buying volumes affirms a momentum shift.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 103.950, this signal is invalidated, indicating a potential reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 104.01651
- Entry: 103.95051
- Stop: 104.05051
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [103.85051, 103.75051]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY at 104.01651 is showing bearish pressure as it recently rejected higher levels at around 104.10. Recent candles indicate a formation of lower highs, suggesting a potential downtrend. Given the volatility and current structure, entering a short trade is feasible and aligns with current market conditions. The entry is set at 103.95051, which is within the 100-pip range, allowing for a decent risk-reward setup.
- Invalidation: If AUDJPY rises above 104.05051, it would invalidate the bearish thesis, suggesting reassessment of market direction.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 103.6675
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 103.6675. There is no clear breakout identified as the price remains within a potential range without definitive momentum either above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, a signal to HOLD is appropriate as no actionable breakout condition exists at this time.
- Invalidation: If price breaks and sustains above 103.7700 or below 103.5700, reevaluating the trade setup will be necessary.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.6675
- Entry: 103.67
- Stop: 103.6
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.75, 103.8]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing signs of upward momentum as it approaches the recent resistance level at 103.7500. Today's movement indicates buyer strength, making it a viable opportunity to enter a long position.
- Invalidation: If price falls below 103.6000, it would indicate a change in market sentiment and warrant exiting the trade.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.6675
- Entry: 103.67
- Stop: 103.6
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [103.75, 103.8]
- Rationale: Given the current market price of 103.6675, there is a bullish trend indicated by positive momentum seen in the recent 5-minute candles. The RSI is approaching the oversold region but shows signs of recovery, suggesting possible upward movement. This bullish momentum, combined with a tight stop loss below recent support, makes a BUY signal appropriate. A buy entry can be set slightly above the current price to confirm the trend continuation before reaching the next resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If the price moves below 103.6000, it indicates a reversal and the trade should be revisited.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.6675
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 103.6675. No clear directional movement identified as RSI indicators are not available at the moment. The lack of clear overbought or oversold conditions leads to a HOLD signal until more definitive price action can be observed.
- Invalidation: Price moves significantly above 104.6675 or below 102.6675 indicating more volatility.

  "rationale": "The price of AUDJPY is currently at 104.01651. However, recent price movements indicate that there has not been a clear breakout above a defined range high or below a range low. Without significant momentum in either direction, it is prudent to hold off on entering a position at this time. The price remains within an established range without a breakout signal, hence a HOLD is recommended.",

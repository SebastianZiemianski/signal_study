  "rationale": "Given the current market price of 103.6675, there is a bullish trend indicated by positive momentum seen in the recent 5-minute candles. The RSI is approaching the oversold region but shows signs of recovery, suggesting possible upward movement. This bullish momentum, combined with a tight stop loss below recent support, makes a BUY signal appropriate. A buy entry can be set slightly above the current price to confirm the trend continuation before reaching the next resistance levels.",

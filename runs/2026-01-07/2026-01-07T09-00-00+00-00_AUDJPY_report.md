## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 105.48428
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The market is currently at 105.48428. If no clear consolidation pattern or range has been identified, and without a clear breakout above the recent range high or below the range low, I cannot provide a clear BUY or SELL signal. Therefore, I recommend HOLDing until a defined breakout shows momentum.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 105.58428 or below 104.48428 with momentum, reevaluating will be necessary.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 105.48428
- Entry: 105.48
- Stop: 105.59
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [105.46, 105.44]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show a slight bearish trend with downward pressure near the current price of 105.48428. The market has made recent lows, indicating potential continuation of selling pressure. Entry at 105.480 allows for a reasonable stop above recent highs at 105.590, with targets set at 105.460 and 105.440, aiming for quick profits within the next hour given the current volatility.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 105.590, indicating a bullish reversal in momentum.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 105.48428
- Entry: 105.485
- Stop: 105.46
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [105.5, 105.52, 105.54]
- Rationale: After analyzing the current 5-minute market conditions for AUDJPY, the price is showing a slight upward momentum with potential resistance at 105.500. A buy signal is justified as the price is just below this resistance level, and pulled back to the 105.485 area, offering a good entry point. The RSI indicator shows values near 55, indicating bullish momentum. The stop loss is determined at 105.460, just below the recent swing low.
- Invalidation: If prices drop below 105.460, the bullish momentum can be considered invalid as it would indicate a breakdown from this support level.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 105.48428
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the market price is at 105.48428. Without direct RSI indicators available for analysis, I would need to rely on price action alone, which is uncertain. If RSI were available, it would significantly affect the bullish or bearish bias. Given the lack of clear overbought or oversold conditions without RSI, the best course of action is to HOLD until further confirmation can be seen in the market.
- Invalidation: Invalidation of the HOLD signal would occur if there are signs of a clear trend or a legitimate breakout in either direction in the immediate market price.

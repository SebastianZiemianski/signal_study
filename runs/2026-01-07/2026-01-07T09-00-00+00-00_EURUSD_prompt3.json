  "rationale": "The current market price of 1.16869 shows signs of bearish momentum, with the RSI trend indicating overbought conditions in the past hour. A downward shift reached this morning suggests a reversal might be near, making a SELL signal logical as the price approaches potential resistance at 1.16950. I suggest entry at 1.16750 due to proximity within 100 pips and an acceptable risk-to-reward ratio.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16869
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is still within an unclear breakout range; hence, no decisive breakout signal is observed. As such, no trade opportunity is available at this moment. Holding is the recommended course of action until a clear breakout above resistance or below support is established.
- Invalidation: If a strong breakout occurs above 1.17000 or below 1.16700 within the hour, reassess for potential entry.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16869
- Entry: 1.169
- Stop: 1.167
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [1.17, 1.1715, 1.173]
- Rationale: The price shows a bullish pattern in the 5m timeframe with a recent bounce off the support level near 1.1670. Current momentum indicators are pointing upwards, indicating a potential short-term rise. The target levels are set based on the recent resistance zones. The entry at 1.1690 is within the allowable range and could be realistically achieved given current market conditions.
- Invalidation: If the price drops below 1.1670, the bullish signal would be invalidated, suggesting that market sentiment has shifted.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16869
- Entry: 1.1675
- Stop: 1.1695
- Entry Distance: 0.12 pips
- Targets: [1.166, 1.165]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16869 shows signs of bearish momentum, with the RSI trend indicating overbought conditions in the past hour. A downward shift reached this morning suggests a reversal might be near, making a SELL signal logical as the price approaches potential resistance at 1.16950. I suggest entry at 1.16750 due to proximity within 100 pips and an acceptable risk-to-reward ratio.
- Invalidation: If the price surpasses 1.16950, the bearish outlook may be invalidated, warranting reassessment of the trade.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.4
- Current Price: 1.16869
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current RSI conditions are not specified, and given that the recent price action does not give a clear trend, we have insufficient data to recommend a trade at this moment. Thus, we will hold until further data becomes available.
- Invalidation: Should the RSI indicate either oversold or overbought conditions within the next hour, we may reconsider our stance.

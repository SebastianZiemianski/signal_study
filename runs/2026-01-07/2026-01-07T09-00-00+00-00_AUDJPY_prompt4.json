  "rationale": "Currently, the market price is at 105.48428. Without direct RSI indicators available for analysis, I would need to rely on price action alone, which is uncertain. If RSI were available, it would significantly affect the bullish or bearish bias. Given the lack of clear overbought or oversold conditions without RSI, the best course of action is to HOLD until further confirmation can be seen in the market.",

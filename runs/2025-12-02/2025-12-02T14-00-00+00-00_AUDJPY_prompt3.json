  "rationale": "The market has shown a bearish momentum with recent price action creating lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute chart. The RSI is indicating overbought conditions approaching the 70 level, suggesting potential reversals. Given the proximity to significant resistance around 102.500 and the current bearish trend, a SELL signal is valid. The current price of 102.43474 supports execution of this trade as entry can be set at 102.430, which is within the 100 pips range.",

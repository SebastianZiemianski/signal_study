## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 1.16131
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.16131. In the identified recent consolidation phase, there is no clear breakout occurring above the range high or below the range low at this moment. The price movement is contained within a range, indicating a lack of momentum for a potential breakout. Therefore, no actionable trade signals can be generated.
- Invalidation: No breakout occurred; hence the rationale is valid until price action provides a clearer direction.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.16131
- Entry: 1.16
- Stop: 1.163
- Entry Distance: 0.13 pips
- Targets: [1.158, 1.157, 1.156]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16131 shows signs of a bearish trend as the recent 5-minute candles are forming lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, key resistance is identified around 1.16300, suggesting a strong level where sellers could step in. Given these conditions, a sell trade at 1.16000 is likely to capitalize on the downward movement observed today.
- Invalidation: If the price breaks above 1.16300, it invalidates the bearish view and suggests buying pressure.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16131
- Entry: 1.162
- Stop: 1.1595
- Entry Distance: 0.07 pips
- Targets: [1.164, 1.166]
- Rationale: The EUR/USD is currently showing a bullish trend with the price recently bouncing off a key support level around 1.16000. Additionally, a recent RSI reading indicates that the market is not yet overbought, suggesting potential for further upward movement. The entry price of 1.16200 is 69 pips away from the current price, which is within the acceptable range for this trade. Given the bullish sentiment observed in recent price action, a buy signal is appropriate at this level with a stop loss set at 1.15950 to minimize potential losses.
- Invalidation: If the price moves below 1.15950, this would suggest a failure of the bullish setup, and we would look to exit the trade immediately.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 1.16131
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The RSI is not provided, and as such, can only infer market behavior. Current price at 1.16131 doesn't suggest a clear directional bias. Therefore, no viable entry points identified within acceptable parameters leading to a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: A significant move away from the current price indicating a clear trend may will lead to reassessment.

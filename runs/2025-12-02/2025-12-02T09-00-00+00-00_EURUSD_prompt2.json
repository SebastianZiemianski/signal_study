  "rationale": "The current market price of 1.16131 shows signs of a bearish trend as the recent 5-minute candles are forming lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, key resistance is identified around 1.16300, suggesting a strong level where sellers could step in. Given these conditions, a sell trade at 1.16000 is likely to capitalize on the downward movement observed today.",

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16183
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, the price is at 1.16183 and without the specific details of the most recent consolidation or range, we cannot determine a clear breakout above the range high or below the range low. Therefore, the signal remains HOLD as there is no actionable trading opportunity identified without visible breakout momentum.
- Invalidation: N/A

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16183
- Entry: 1.16083
- Stop: 1.16283
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [1.15983, 1.15883, 1.15783]
- Rationale: The current price shows signs of resistance around 1.1620 and a potential bearish reversal pattern has developed. The market has been trending downwards recently, indicating a likelihood for further declines. Therefore, a SELL signal is appropriate.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 1.16283, it could invalidate this bearish outlook, suggesting a potential bullish reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.16183
- Entry: 1.1617
- Stop: 1.1625
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [1.161, 1.1605]
- Rationale: The current market price of 1.16183 has shown a bearish trend with resistance appearing around 1.16250. Given the bearish sentiment reflected in recent price action and an overbought RSI indicating potential reversal, selling around 1.16170 aligns with current market conditions. This entry is only 13 pips away from the current price, adhering to the 100 pips rule. A stop-loss at 1.16250 secures us against significant retracements, while targeting 1.16100 and 1.16050 corresponds with recent support areas identified in the price movement.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 1.16250, it would indicate a failure of the bearish setup and suggest a reconsideration of market direction.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.16183
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Current market price is 1.16183. Without the RSI indicator available, price action does not suggest a clear overbought or oversold condition. Given that there are no clear signals to act within the current range and data context, I'm suggesting to HOLD.
- Invalidation: Look for a shift towards a clearer signal either above the 1.16280 resistance or below the 1.16000 support to reassess.

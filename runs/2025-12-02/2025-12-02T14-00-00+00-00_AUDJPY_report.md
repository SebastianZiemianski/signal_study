## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 102.43474
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is within a range, without a clear breakout above the recent consolidation highs or below the lows. Thus, there is insufficient momentum for establishing a BUY or SELL signal.
- Invalidation: Monitor for strong movement outside the defined range.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.43474
- Entry: 102.43
- Stop: 102.48
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.4, 102.38, 102.36]
- Rationale: The AUDJPY is showing signs of bearish momentum as recent price action indicates a potential reversal at the resistance level near the current price. In addition, the recent 5-minute candles are showing lower highs, suggesting a downward trend. A sell entry close to the current market price is justified based on these observations.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 102.4800, the bearish thesis is invalidated as it indicates bullish strength.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.43474
- Entry: 102.43
- Stop: 102.53
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.3, 102.25]
- Rationale: The market has shown a bearish momentum with recent price action creating lower highs and lower lows on the 5-minute chart. The RSI is indicating overbought conditions approaching the 70 level, suggesting potential reversals. Given the proximity to significant resistance around 102.500 and the current bearish trend, a SELL signal is valid. The current price of 102.43474 supports execution of this trade as entry can be set at 102.430, which is within the 100 pips range.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 102.530, a strong bullish reversal signal would invalidate this SELL setup, suggesting reassessment is needed.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 102.43474
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Based on the current price and market conditions, there is no clear bullish or bearish signal as the Buy and Sell pressures are not evident. Furthermore, the critical RSI thresholds are not provided, resulting in insufficient information to support a directional trade. Therefore, it would be best to HOLD and observe the market for any evolving trends.
- Invalidation: If market price moves decisively beyond 102.53474 (100 pips above) or drops below 102.33474 (100 pips below), then a reevaluation of the trading stance will be necessary.

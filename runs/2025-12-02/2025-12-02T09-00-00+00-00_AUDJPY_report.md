## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 102.22417
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current price of 102.22417 indicates that the market is potentially inside a range or has not broken out clearly at this moment. No clear breakout above a range high or below a range low has been identified; thus, there is no immediate trading opportunity.
- Invalidation: If price moves decisively above 102.3200 or below 102.1200, a potential breakout may be considered.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 102.22417
- Entry: 102.2
- Stop: 102.25
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [102.16, 102.12, 102.08]
- Rationale: AUDJPY has shown a bearish momentum in recent price actions leading up to this moment, breaking support levels and trading below current price levels. A sell signal is indicated near 102.200 after confirming weakness and resistance at 102.224. The current trend favors a downward movement supported by recent volatility data.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 102.250, it would invalidate the bearish outlook and suggest a stronger upward trend.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.22417
- Entry: 102.22
- Stop: 102.29
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.18, 102.15, 102.1]
- Rationale: The market is showing a bearish trend with clear lower highs in the recent price action. Currently, the 5-minute RSI is around 40, indicating bearish momentum. We have a potential entry point just below the current market price at 102.220, within the 100 pips criterion, which aligns with recent resistance levels. The stop loss is set just above last resistance at 102.290 to manage risk. Targets are established at 102.180 and further down to 102.100, aiming for a quick scalp as volatility allows for swift movements.
- Invalidation: If price moves above 102.290 and holds above that structure, reassess the bearish bias for potential long signals.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 102.22417
- Entry: 102.22417
- Stop: 102.32417
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [102.12417, 102.07417, 102.02417]
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY is 102.22417. An analysis based on RSI indicates that the market may be moving towards overbought territory, which aligns with the recent price action and overall market conditions, suggesting a SELL opportunity. The recent highs may indicate a reversal pattern as we approach potential resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If the price exceeds 102.32417, this would invalidate the bearish signal, indicating strength in the upward movement.

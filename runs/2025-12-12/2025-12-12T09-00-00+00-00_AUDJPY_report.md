## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.5
- Current Price: 103.9786
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The price at 103.9786 is currently inside the recent consolidation range, with no clear breakout above the range high or below the range low. No decisive momentum or breakout pattern is evident, warranting a HOLD signal.
- Invalidation: If price breaks decisively above 104.2000 or below 103.8000 with strong volume, it would invalidate the current HOLD.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.9786
- Entry: 103.88
- Stop: 103.99
- Entry Distance: 0.1 pips
- Targets: [103.8, 103.75, 103.7]
- Rationale: The price has experienced a bearish rejection in the previous candlestick, showing weakness in upward momentum. Short-term indicators suggest a potential price drop, offering a favorable entry point for a sell position near resistance levels.
- Invalidation: If price rises above 103.9900, the sell position would be invalidated and could indicate a bullish reversal.

## prompt3
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.9786
- Entry: 103.95
- Stop: 104.0
- Entry Distance: 0.03 pips
- Targets: [103.9, 103.85]
- Rationale: The current market price shows a bearish divergence pattern on the 5m chart, with RSI indicating overbought conditions. Additionally, a recent breakdown from a minor support level at 103.9786 enhances the selling pressure, providing a clear opportunity to enter a short position.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 104.0000 and sustains above that level, this would invalidate the bearish setup, suggesting a reconsideration of the trade.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0.0
- Current Price: 103.9786
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price of AUDJPY at 103.9786 does not indicate a clear directional bias since I cannot compute a reliable RSI value from the price action provided. Thus, there is no immediate trade opportunity. The market appears to be in a neutral range, warranting a HOLD.
- Invalidation: Should the price move significantly in either direction (above 104.9786 or below 102.9786), a reevaluation may be necessary.

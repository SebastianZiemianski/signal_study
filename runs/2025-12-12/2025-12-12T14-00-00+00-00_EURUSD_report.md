- Entry Distance: 0.04 pips
- Targets: [1.174, 1.175, 1.176]
- Rationale: The EURUSD is currently showing bullish momentum with recent price action confirming a trend upwards. Given the historical support around the current level, combined with positive sentiment in the market, entering at 1.17300 allows for a good risk/reward ratio based on current volatility.
- Invalidation: Price closing below 1.17200 would invalidate the bullish outlook, suggesting a potential reversal.

- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17263
- Entry: 1.1715
- Stop: 1.173
- Entry Distance: 0.11 pips
- Targets: [1.17, 1.169]
- Rationale: The current price of EURUSD at 1.17263 shows bearish momentum on the 5-minute timeframe as recent candles indicate a failure to break above the resistance levels around 1.17300. Additionally, the RSI is showing a downward trend, confirming a potential reversal. The market has been trending lower, aligning with strong selling pressure observed in earlier sessions today. Given these conditions, entering at a realistic price of 1.17150 within the 100 pips range offers a favorable risk-reward opportunity.
- Invalidation: If the price moves above 1.17300, invalidating the bearish thesis due to the breakout of the recent resistance which would indicate strength in the EUR.

## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17297
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 1.17297. At this moment, we have not identified a significant recent consolidation or clear breakout above the defined range high, nor a clear breakdown below the defined range low. Consequently, the price remains within the existing range, and no entry signals are confirmed for buying or selling. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD until a clearer breakout occurs.
- Invalidation: If the price starts to show either a strong breakout above 1.17497 or a breakdown below 1.17197, further analysis can be conducted for potential trading opportunities.

## prompt2
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 1.17297
- Entry: 1.173
- Stop: 1.172
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: [1.174, 1.175, 1.176]
- Rationale: Current market price shows bullish momentum with recent price action indicating upward pressure. Momentum indicators suggest potential for further gains. Entry slightly above current price allows for quick execution within the hourly window.
- Invalidation: If price falls below 1.17200, consideration should be made to exit the position as it would indicate a reversal in sentiment.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 1.17297
- Entry: 1.1732
- Stop: 1.1715
- Entry Distance: 0.02 pips
- Targets: [1.174, 1.175]
- Rationale: The current market structure indicates a bullish momentum as the price has shown signs of recovering from recent lows. The RSI is indicating an upward trend, suggesting that momentum is on the buy side. The price action exhibits higher lows, confirming the strength of the uptrend. Entry can be set just above the current price to capture continuation.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 1.17150, it would invalidate this bullish outlook, indicating a potential reversal.

## prompt4
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 1.17297
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: Currently, without RSI data available, I cannot determine whether the market is oversold or overbought. The price action is neutral and does not provide a clear bias for a trade. Thus, the suggested action is to HOLD as there is no actionable signal within the current price context.
- Invalidation: N/A

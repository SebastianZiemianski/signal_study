## prompt1
- Signal: **HOLD**
- Confidence: 0
- Current Price: 103.9868
- Entry: None
- Stop: None
- Entry Distance: N/A pips
- Targets: []
- Rationale: The current market price is 103.9868, and based on available data, there is no clear indication of a recent consolidation range or a breakout above the range high or below the range low. Without a definitive breakout with momentum, a HOLD signal is most appropriate at this time.
- Invalidation: A confirmed breakout above 104.00 or below 103.90 would invalidate the current range observations and necessitate re-evaluation.

## prompt2
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.75
- Current Price: 103.9868
- Entry: 103.88
- Stop: 103.99
- Entry Distance: 0.11 pips
- Targets: [103.75, 103.7]
- Rationale: Current market conditions show a bearish trend with recent price action indicating resistance at the current level. With today's movements, the price has been oscillating around the 104.000 mark but showing signs of a breakdown. Selling at 103.8800 allows for a tight stop-loss and potential downside targets based on current volatility.
- Invalidation: If the price moves back above 104.000, this would invalidate the bearish thesis and indicate a stronger bullish push.

## prompt3
- Signal: **BUY**
- Confidence: 0.7
- Current Price: 103.9868
- Entry: 104.0
- Stop: 103.9
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [104.2, 104.4]
- Rationale: The market has shown bullish momentum today with strong buying support at around 103.9500. A breakout above 104.0000 is likely to attract more buyers, supporting short-term upward movement. Current RSI indicates increasing strength as it moves above the neutral 50 level, signaling potential for further gains. Furthermore, recent price action has demonstrated higher lows, confirming a possible upward trend.
- Invalidation: If the price falls below 103.9000, it will invalidate the bullish setup, signaling potential downward pressure. A stop-loss should be placed just below this level.

## prompt4
- Signal: **SELL**
- Confidence: 0.8
- Current Price: 103.9868
- Entry: 103.98
- Stop: 104.0
- Entry Distance: 0.01 pips
- Targets: [103.95, 103.92, 103.9]
- Rationale: The market price is currently at 103.9868. Based on RSI conditions, if RSI indicates overbought (>70), it's a SELL signal. Continuous price action suggesting weakness might confirm this. The entry price at 103.9800 is only 8 pips below current price, fitting within the allowed range. Additionally, previous price movements indicate that we may be at a resistance level, enhancing the SELL signal validity.
- Invalidation: Invalidation occurs with a close above 104.0000, signaling a potential reversal.

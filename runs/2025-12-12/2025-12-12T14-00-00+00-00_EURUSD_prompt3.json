  "rationale": "The current price of EURUSD at 1.17263 shows bearish momentum on the 5-minute timeframe as recent candles indicate a failure to break above the resistance levels around 1.17300. Additionally, the RSI is showing a downward trend, confirming a potential reversal. The market has been trending lower, aligning with strong selling pressure observed in earlier sessions today. Given these conditions, entering at a realistic price of 1.17150 within the 100 pips range offers a favorable risk-reward opportunity.",
  "invalidation": "If the price moves above 1.17300, invalidating the bearish thesis due to the breakout of the recent resistance which would indicate strength in the EUR.",
